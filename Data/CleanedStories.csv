1,2020-09-07,"Man I tried. I had a gal lined up to join Military Intelligence then Covid hit, they delayed her enlistment, her Army nurse sister talked her out of it. So I‚Äôm chipping in to help her finish her BSN while she works at a dementia care facility. She‚Äôll be an amazing nurse I‚Äôm sure."
2,2020-09-07,My grandmother requires 24/7 supervision due to her dementia. The healthcare worker who is supposed to assist this evening just got back from out of state travel to a large funeral. The coordinating care facility's response to our concern is that you can catch covid anywhere. üôÑ
3,2020-09-07,"I cry too, my 92 year old mum with advanced dementia, I‚Äôve not seen since Sept. My family terrified she catches COVID in her nursing home. Grateful people keep her safe so that she can see out her days safely and comfortably. See a different perspective and get off your soap box "
4,2020-09-07,Now that covid has killed my mom I am going to be nasty to these people. She lived in assisted living and hadn‚Äôt been outside in 2 years bc of dementia and these asswipes have killed her
5,2020-09-07,"Depends on the comorbidities. When I see them adding in Alzheimers and vascular dementia I call foul My Dad technically died of pneumonia but it was because his Alzheimers made him forget how to cough If you are in cardiac arrest or heart failure you are in danger, Covid or not"
6,2020-09-07,My friends nan had dementia for ages and she was put down as a covid death?
7,2020-09-07,"Watched another heart breaking story of dementia  and separation @STVNews caused by Covid restrictions. It‚Äôs not even about indoor  and outdoor visiting, it‚Äôs about closeness and touch. Why can‚Äôt I hold my Mums hand with a glove on and a mask AND having been tested? @scotgov @JeaneF1MSP"
8,2020-09-07,It's about Labor UNIONS. You know the thing that you and the GOP are trying to kill so you don't have to pay a living wage. Shouldn't you be out trying to get Covid so our economy can open? 
9,2020-09-07,"My mum received the covid virus as a free gift whilst on a 2 week stay in hospital with gastroenteritis, she came out far worse than she went in. Don't know of anyone else who has had the virus only a family friend who died through dementia but his death certificate States covid"
10,2020-09-07,Really cross to be told my mum - dementia and diabetes- still can't have her foot appt (cancelled at start of lockdown) as surgery only allowed 15 min appts to reduce covid risk. A hair appt takes longer and that's seen as ok. No logic to what's allowed.
11,2020-09-07,"Or live alone with dementia and all the trouble I have. I can't even drive myself to a doctor. I don't remember all the rules myself. I'm terrible at wearing a mask. Someone pointed out I had it inside out at the covid testing place. Im gonna die, I hope. Im tired of life."
12,2020-09-07,"Youre right actually, he decelerated our response to covid which decelerated the economy. The dementia/pedo accusation is a big time projection from the MAGA groupies...dude has more pics w/Epstein  and  Maxwell than most people have with their family."
13,2020-09-07,So you‚Äôre going to cut me off because I don‚Äôt have the newest iPhone? Honestly? This game has gotten me through the COVID Physical distancing. It‚Äôs given me some peace from my moms Dementia diagnosis. SERIOUSLY???? Come on man. So disappointed
14,2020-09-07,Months before my father-in-law was diagnosed with dementia he began to act erratically.
15,2020-09-07,"We too live in Cornwall, with 90yr Mammy on the West Coast, we sometimes drive to Crewe and get the train up (train all the way 13hrs!) Or drive stopping overnight half way. She has Alzheimer‚Äôs & dementia and is now struggling with depression due to Covid. Stay strong!"
16,2020-09-07,My grandpa fell and hit his head and has been admitted to the hospital. They just called my mom to let her know he‚Äôs been fighting the nurses and keeps knocking his IV thing over. ü•∫ he has really bad dementia and they won‚Äôt let my grandma in with him because of covid.
17,2020-09-06,Some people have it hard at the other extreme. My mate`s mum and dad celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary but sadly his mum succumbed to Covid-19 aged 98. Coping with parents with dementia cannot be easy.
18,2020-09-06,"I've seen a massive rise & progression in dementia in my practice since the lockdowns. Deaths from dementia (not COVID) jumped by 20,000 per week during max lockdowns. Because lockdowns kill. When I say #OpenUpUSA it triggers people. As if they care for lives  and  I don't. Silly"
19,2020-09-06,My Mum is in a nursing home with Dementia where there are Covid cases. She still has HS subscription because it makes her happy. If she catches it and dies cancelling it will be one of the first things I do....
20,2020-09-06,"Depending on the status of COVID in your area, going to a polling place has risks. Since I take care of my 78 year old dad with early dementia and heart disease and strokes, I‚Äôm not willing to risk it and will vote by mail for the first time."
21,2020-09-06,This is so unfair üò≠ my papaw has alzheimers/dementia and covid restrictions have been hard on him and my mamaw. Yesterday was their 56th anniversary and this is how they had to spend it. üíî 
22,2020-09-06,I sympathise. My mother-in-law's care home has had to stop all visits because visitors disobeyed rules and now they have new cases of covid. She also suffers from dementia. The problem was that visitors cared only about their own family members and not about other residents/staff
23,2020-09-06,"I detest Johnson and his cohort with every fibre of my being but can we all stay at home for ever? Covid is here to stay along with AIDS, Polio cancer dementia etc etc life‚Äôs a lottery if you live in UK you have a winning ticket in Syria less so"
24,2020-09-06,Would help me in paying medical bills for my dad he suffers from dementia and with the covid things have been very challenging
25,2020-09-06,My son has CHD and has been no masks in classroom. My concern is not only for his health but I work in dementia care home. We have been covid free throughout. This could all be ruined by kids not wearing masks like I have to in my job #COVID2019 #ProtectOurChildren #WearAMask
26,2020-09-06,"I just got off the phone w/ my aunt(mothers sister) who has dementia  and  currently battlin Covid. Just hearing her voice crushed me. I couldn't stay on the phone, tears were poring down my face  and  I didnt want her 2 hear my sobs. I already lost two family members this year.2020 sigh"
27,2020-09-06,For me when I am having a really bad day I do not watch tv or read about it. It is now three weeks since I became unwell and two weeks when I received my positive result for covid. Believe me looking after my mum with dementia and special needs brother whilst having covid.
28,2020-09-06,"My neighbors father had advanced dementia and on the verge of death. Due to organs shutting down, he had a day perhaps two. His death certificate states he died of Covid. I‚Äôm hearing about similar stories around the country. What‚Äôs the real count. Needs to be investigated"
29,2020-09-06,"In the U.K. my relative with dementia was upset  and  confused why they could not see their family. His wife went along with rules  and  he died anyway, not of covid. After 50 years of seeing him every day, last 3 months he was alone üíîGo see relatives before it is too late. Fight for it"
30,2020-09-06,"Where the fuck were these in Feb/March when my grandad and 80% of the old folks in his dementia room were all killed off by COVID? Useless unprepared, too fucking late fuck head."
31,2020-09-06,"Think he means quite often, these people were just allowed to die. How many while probably not in their best interests could have been saved. Including my 82 year old best mates grandpa who is is the only person I know to have died WITH Covid. He had severe dementia."
32,2020-09-06,"Spot on. My Paramedic wife doesn‚Äôt have to gown up to the hilt to help heart disease and dementia patients. She has seen first hand the efforts of Covid-19 and is fearful of catching it  and  passing it on to us, her family. Welch  and  Madeley can keep ignorance to themselves"
33,2020-09-06,"As a person under 55 I am more likely to die in the bath than of covid, yet my business has almost been entirely sacrificed and my mother cannot get care assistance as her dementia diagnosis has been delayed since Mar as appointments are cancelled. It‚Äôs just ridiculous"
34,2020-09-06,I'm a constituent. I'm an ITU nurse who cared for COVID patients during the petrifying peak of the pandemic. I just want you to help me visit my mum (with dementia)in her care home before she dies.
35,2020-09-06,I was asked to understand the pressure an #MIT professor was under in this Covid climate while never being asked my position. My mother died from #Covid19. My father is post Covid with dementia. But... your CI  and  interest rate are of my top concern? #FOH. Be a human first Profs.
36,2020-09-06,"My mom's in a home 4 dementia. Her drs said I'd b held 4 elder abuse if I let her go back home. I'm disabled Put her in a place she liked. She wasn't even all unpacked when Covid hit. Mar 9, everything locked up. Haven't seen her since. Opened in Aug outside, but too hot. ... /1"
37,2020-09-06,My godmother‚Äôs mother. The care-home she was in is one that specialises in providing care to people with dementia; so when Covid-19 went tearing through it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äújust*‚Äù people in their 90s like her who died. *because as we know the elderly‚Äôs deaths don‚Äôt count ü§®üò†
38,2020-09-06,"Okay, would he have died if he didn't get covid. That's the difference. My dad had dementia. He got pneumonia and that was the cause of death. It they can't say he died of the head injury, they can't list that on the death cert. Covid chose the ending in this case."
39,2020-09-05,"Sports is an escape for me. Gets my mind off of the stress if my job. I work in a hospital, ever hear of covid-19? Dementia, Cancer and Alcoholism to name a few things. That's why I need to escape. Players are free to protest, kneel whatever. I just want to watch a game."
40,2020-09-05,oh also your loved ones have to be dying from covid for it to be novel at this point apparently lol my grandmas been dying for years because she has dementia and barely remembers who i am and has panic attacks every 30 seconds and strokes constantly but won‚Äôt tell anyone bc she
41,2020-09-05,Being able to see my mum in the nursing home before she passed over. (Dementia) And then having to have a covid-19 funeral for her large family instead of a normal one.
42,2020-09-05,"ü§£ Why is this so hard for y‚Äôall to understand? Some of the other causes include: Poisoning Accidents Adverse events Dementia Sepsis Cancer Heart failure Wow, I had no idea...COVID now causes cancer and heart failure now too?!? Where‚Äôs my mask?!?! "
43,2020-09-05,"I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss. My beautiful, sweet, kind Mom just passed a few days ago after battling dementia as well. It is a disease that robs you of so much, and such a difficult time to lose a loved one during Covid. My thoughts are with you and your family."
44,2020-09-05,"180,000 dead Americans. Lmao. 10,000 due to Covid, thank you. My 83 year old aunt w/dementia in nurse home, q-tined since Feb, just had and recovered from ‚Äúdeadly‚Äù Covid in THREE DAYS. The election infection!"
45,2020-09-05,"...I guess I‚Äôm pretty good with my patients who have dementia. Doing anything with a child takes twice as long and you have to speak really clearly and slowly at times, and those skills have been really useful..."
46,2020-09-05,This was one of my fav stories we have done lately. My wife works in skilled nursing & tells me all the time how her patients have struggled since COVID-19 and not seeing family. Many have dementia  and  don‚Äôt understand. So happy for this couple! ‚ù§Ô∏è 
47,2020-09-05,"Feel your pain Chris ,my mum had vascular dementia was sad watching her memories fade,might sound bad but I was kinda glad when in her care home covid took her before she totally forgot her memories"
48,2020-09-05,"Just had a bit of worrying news, a member of staff at my 86 year old dementia suffering dads care home has contracted Covid  and  the care home has gone into full lockdown."
49,2020-09-05,"Speaking of old ladies in nursing homes, my stepgrandmother, who is ancient and far gone from dementia, has COVID now. I just hope it doesn't cause her any suffering."
50,2020-09-05,Excuse my ignorance but does a sympathetic trend have an inverse relationship? My dad has dementia and is mid 70s. He‚Äôs a die hard Vietnam vet. I‚Äôm concerned he will get covid at the VA. The VA should give HCQ as a prophylactic to at risk vets.
51,2020-09-05,It's been so hard to only be able to see my mother-in-law who has dementia through a window! Before Covid I sat with her every night for 4-5 hours until she went to sleep. üòï I love those lucid moments! üòä
52,2020-09-05,"Well my dad was in a nursing home, we were not allowed to see him. He also had dementia. Covid is the result and on his death certificate. He also had bed sores which tells me he‚Äôs been staring at a ceiling for months because he couldn‚Äôt speak to defend himself."
53,2020-09-05,I asked my friend how her mom was.. I hadn't seen her in months..she had dementia..she was in nursing home...need I say more? #RIP blood on YOUR hands DICTATOR @NYGovCuomo #COVID 
54,2020-09-05,"My mother lacks capacity - she has vascular dementia, not covid ( and  is 90) Presenting with a mobility issue at A and  E, staff allowed no one whatever past the entrance with her - 'because -covid19' She doesn't even know her address, never mind why she was there /1"
55,2020-09-04,You are requiring all LTC Facilities to begin conducting routine facility wide Covid testing. My loved one‚Äôs facility has not had ONE resident test positive. My LO has dementia. She is a very frail. Are you going to hold her down to get the negative results? Outrageous and cruel!
56,2020-09-04,Exactly! Same my dad has dementia he‚Äôs 76 in a care home survived covid üôèüèº but still not able to visit him üòî But I can go the pub or gym or swimming #Crazy #Covid19UK @BorisJohnson
57,2020-09-04,"I can swim, go to the gym and gamble but no chance of seeing my mum in a care home with end stage dementia which has accelerated by having covid. Five months of visits stolen away from us thanks to lockdown, as our loved one continues to deteriorate. A cruel race against time."
58,2020-09-04,"Not great. I‚Äôm very close with my grandma, she‚Äôs two states away and not doing well. Within a matter of months dementia has appeared and gotten severe. Because of Covid, I‚Äôm afraid she‚Äôll pass before I can see her again."
59,2020-09-04,My dad was finally due to have his dementia assessment today after a long covid-related delay. My dad refused his consent for his dementia assessment today.
60,2020-09-04,"I got laid off due to Covid-19, my father has dementia and I help pay his bills. I have a 2 and 3 yr old at home and I haven't been able to find a job, although I have been steadily seeking employment. üòì please, anything helps $veeurdaneta13"
61,2020-09-04,"My Poppop, in the early stages of dementia, is alone in a hospital right now because of covid regulations and apparently every time someone walks into his room he asks if it‚Äôs my mommom coming in. My fucking heart üíî"
62,2020-09-04,"TFW your mother says she thinks she has dementia  and  should go on Aricept  and  you tell her to tell her doctor so she can get testing  and  she goes to the doc  and  forgets all about it  and  talks about her arthritis instead. (I'd have gone with, but 500km away + COVID. My dad went.)"
63,2020-09-04,It‚Äôs true for some but my homegirls gma died from COVID Last Saturday and all she had was a small touch of dementia . She wasn‚Äôt terminally ill.
64,2020-09-04,I haven‚Äôt seen my Mum since March who has dementia and in a care home. The home is Covid free and it‚Äôs difficult I know to decide but cannot continue to have no contact with family for a continued extended period. #familymatters
65,2020-09-04,In memory of my late Mum suffered from Dementia. Prevention is crucial. 75 Persen Kematian Pasien COVID-19 adalah Penderita Demensia 
66,2020-09-04,"It doesn't matter! They wouldn't have died YET if they didn't catch covid. My 80 year old grandad is a type 2 diabetic, had cancer, a little overweight and is in the very early stages of dementia. Is it alright if he dies now then? What if we don't want him to die yet? Oh well?"
67,2020-09-04,"He has dementia so bad now , he does not know or comprehend my mom or his wife are gone , plus the nursing home is on lock down because of Covid-19 , not sure I will ever see him again right now ."
68,2020-09-04,I am so very sad to see this Chris - I lost my dad this March to Cancer & Dementia just before Covid hit - so we were with him as he passed away in his care home - I cannot imagine how stressful and upsetting it is for those who have not been able to spend time with their loved
69,2020-09-04,I know exactly how you feel. I lost my mum at Easter after battling dementia. Covid eventually ganged up as well. Terrible to see a parent decline so badly.
70,2020-09-04,"I visited my grandpa, Poppi, at his nursing home yesterday. Due to severe dementia and a rapid decline, he had to be separated from my grandma, Nonni. She lives in assisted living but does not qualify for a nursing home. They had to be separated during COVID."
71,2020-09-04,My Oma (my last living grandparent and by FAR my fave) was diagnosed with dementia yesterday. That appointment was supposed to happen in March but got pushed back due to COVID. We won‚Äôt know the severity until the neurologist reviews the CT scan...which can again take months üòû
72,2020-09-04,"Timely!Afraid my 90 year old mother with dementia and complex nursing needs contracted and survived Covid when there were no tests.Not to worry,being evicted from her ¬£17m+ care home by @lpoolcouncil should see her off. #millvina #brushwood #becausewecare #allasbadaseachother"
73,2020-09-04,No they were not. My loved ones didn't die from Covid but you thought it would be a good idea to put it on the death certificate. Didn't know dementia and cancer were linked to Covid. Stop spreading the lies and give us the REAL numbers
74,2020-09-04,"My Dad's 70th birthday was always supposed to be a celebration. Family, friends, laughter. But the reality is my dad has dementia and Covid has robbed us of even seeing him. "
75,2020-09-04,"I support police but I also believe white supremacists have infiltrated law enforcement. My thoughts are with the black and brown officers who are hurting right now, many of whom are dying of COVID."
76,2020-09-04,"Had a 20 minute conversation with Dad tonight. We talked sports, beer and covid. Dad has dementia and won't remember the chat. I will remember it the rest of my life. #Dodgers #WhiteSox and #coldbeer and covid sucks!"
77,2020-09-04,"Well, my anonymous sources say he has dementia AND Covid! ü§£"
78,2020-09-04,And this is my problem with the whole thing. People with late stage dementia and stage 4 cancer are being put down as a COVID death which is absolute horse shit.
79,2020-09-04,Oh Jan - I just lost my mom to dementia  and  Covid and this so painful. My thoughts are with you and your folks.
80,2020-09-04,"It is true, Rory. My dad who has dementia, is in a nursing home. We get 30 min once a week, otherwise it‚Äôs thru a 2in slit in window. He‚Äôd 2 go 2 hospital for a few hrs, had a temp &gt;in isolation for 2 weeks in NH. He had a life before Covid. Now he doesn‚Äôt."
81,2020-09-04,"His last years were hard. My understanding was he contracted Lyme disease twice & had a bunch of other health issues after that, including dementia  and , at the end, COVID. Awfully tough breaks for the athlete I remember, to whom so many Long Island kids of my age looked up."
82,2020-09-03,my dad died jan 3;‚Äúdementia complications‚Äù.was in hospice care. also had double aspiration pneumonia  and  about two weeks before i had a bad cough that came out of nowhere. covid????? we‚Äôll never know. suspect dementia wording cause that got him admitted to hospice.
83,2020-09-03,and what am I supposed to do? think about what affliction Rachel Levine has? As far as my understanding goes she has no affliction. That‚Äôs my opinion. Are you telling me she has covid? ALS? Dementia? What do you think she has?
84,2020-09-03,Same happened to my sister inlaw. Oklahoma City. Her husband was in a nursing home. But they wouldn'tvlet her see him. He died but didn't have COVID. Dementia at 75.
85,2020-09-03,"This is awful. I haven‚Äôt left my community since 3-3-20. I look like the old liberal hippy I am. That puts me at risk of being accosted by a MAGA. This is FL folks. Our MAGAs are old, drink 2 much, over use prescription drugs & dementia comes into play. MAGA  and  COVID keep me home. "
86,2020-09-03,"Hell broke loose when both my parents (dad, a dementia patient wheelchair bound and mom with BP, diabetes) got detected with CoVid. It was the most challenging time of our lives but would like to highlight a few things in this thread which defy lot of myths."
87,2020-09-03,"My mother died from dementia in December. They list it as a cause of death. Sometimes the body is ""looking for a reason to die"". That was a quote for several nursing home employees. Listing those deaths as COVID is not really accurate and it distorts the virus crisis."
88,2020-09-03,"My Dad's next door neighbour is taking matters further over the same thing - his mother was 90 and in advanced stages of dementia, cause of death = covid, no test."
89,2020-09-03,"Not for nothing, but she could have pre dementia. my parents best friend developed it late 40‚Äôs. maybe not covid? Either way, she‚Äôs a massive drama queen and should‚Äôve been taking all those supplements all along ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
90,2020-09-03,"The rest of the deaths marked down as covid deaths were people who'd actually died from the other co-morbidities they had - heart/kidney failure, dementia (like my great aunt), etc."
91,2020-09-03,"My Mum‚Äôs did 2 weeks before official lockdown, they still had 22 deaths. Most people are fine with COVID. The vulnerable should shield but the rest of us get on with living. My original point was that I don‚Äôt appreciate politicians using dementia patients as political pawns"
92,2020-09-03,"1/7 Personal one here. My mum is in her last hours, dying in a nursing home. Because she is at the 'end of life', her children are able to visit one person at a time. Her death won't be recorded as a Covid death, but as a resident with dementia, and having had to be isolated for"
93,2020-09-03,"How sad. COVID is bad enough, but Lewy body dementia is a complete nightmare. It took my grandfather, and it's taking my dad's father-in-law right now. Condolences to his family. "
94,2020-09-03,It's about shinning a light into dark corners. I've watched the trailer. And having recently lost my dad to the same (and covid) I'm so pleased that we are trying to rid the stigma that even exists between different types of dementia. And it's not that rare now as a diagnosis.üëç
95,2020-09-03,Love it!!! Its all about memories! When my lovely passed recently..covid and dementia..music was a great comfort. I ll never forget him moaning..turn that record off!!! Awww And of course it was a Rick Astley song! Give us a song Rick to help us along!!
96,2020-09-03,"R.I.P., sir, suffering from both dementia and COVID-19--double whammy! "
97,2020-09-03,My elderly mom passed away last week after being in lockdown since February. My friend‚Äôs mom passed away this week. Both elderly with dementia living in a facility deprived of family contact. Protecting them from covid is killing them. üíî
98,2020-09-03,People with dementia are much more susceptible. 22 residents have died of COVID in my Mum‚Äôs home without visitors
99,2020-09-03,She doesn‚Äôt know as any mail comes to me & unfortunately these days she‚Äôs so very confused ( lockdown/Covid has had a terrible effect on her condition) she wouldn‚Äôt understand what it was about. This is partly my point they want to charge people with Dementia for a tv licence ü§¨.
100,2020-09-03,He was one of my favorites! I heard Lewey Body dementia and COVID. Tough combination.
101,2020-09-03,My heart can‚Äôt take it. Lost my Mom to Lewy Body Dementia 1 yr ago next week. I would never let her have that much stress. Let him hangout with his grandkids  and  enjoy his time he has left!
102,2020-09-03,"Covid too. He had Lewey body dementia which my dad had. Less memory loss, more ‚Äúseeing‚Äù things that don‚Äôt exist."
103,2020-09-03,"""Lewy body dementia and COVID-19"" Watching the @Mets as a little girl with my father... üíôüß° #RIP"
104,2020-09-03,"I already posted on that, right after my original post. To repeat - apparently he couldn't enjoy his Golden Years that much, as he had Lewy Body Dementia - which drove Robin Williams to suicide. He contracted COVID-19,and died. If you do search, you'll see."
105,2020-09-03,I‚Äôm mystified about how he would have gotten Covid when he‚Äôs been basically housebound with dementia for more than a year.
106,2020-09-03,Cause of death was Lewy Dementia and #COVID__19 Hurts my heart.
107,2020-09-03,Agreed ...my father also died at 75 from Lewy body dementia. To add COVID is horrific. Best to his family. 
108,2020-09-03,"That makes three things I heard: dementia, Lyme Disease and now possibly COVID. He was a big reason I started following baseball. My dad was an avid Yankee fan, so we had quite the rivalry"
109,2020-09-03,This guy was the one my coaches pointed to as a kid the way I did with Maddox. As someone that lost a parent from Lewy Body Dementia I assure you Covid played zero role in his fate! He was late stage LBD! RIP to a legend! 
110,2020-09-03,My father lived for many years with this dementia and I would have been devastated if he had died of COVID.
111,2020-09-03,"My Aunt used to say ‚Äúyou have to look after yourself to look after others‚Äù - it‚Äôs working for me - I employ folk who are very thankful and pay rent for a long time loyal friend who lost his job with Covid, I‚Äôm always there for my cousin who‚Äôs looking after my Aunt with Dementia."
112,2020-09-03,"#RIP Just to be clear, Covid is what ended up taking his life, but he suffered from Lewy Bodies dementia, which is a horrible disease. We lost my stepmother to it at the end of last year.I only hope is that his family talks about it publicly."
113,2020-09-03,"So sad. My dad was a fan. ""The Valley legend passed away on Monday, Aug. 31 due to complications of Lewy body dementia and COVID-19, according to the National Baseball Hall of Fame."""
114,2020-09-03,So different stories coming out.. Lymes and others say he had covid with his dimentia.. Certainly doesnt change the sad narrative. But i am curious... My mother in law has Lewey Body Demntia too and is in FL.. Always so concerned for her getting covid.
115,2020-09-03,"I just saw. Complications from Lewy body dementia and Covid. Growing up I always tried to emulate his windup. The arms lifted high over the head, the big knee kick up to the chest and the explosion through the ball with my knee touching the dirt."
116,2020-09-03,"well, it is unfortunate to say this, but after a long time of suffering from dementia, and his short lasting case of COVID-19, my grandfather has officially died on the morning of September 2nd, 2020."
117,2020-09-02,"My brother Rick is being transferred to another hospital to get a definitive diagnosis of ALS. Didnt see him all year due to covid, went to visit and he could hardly walk, eat, hes slurring, has dementia, atrophied muscles. We thought stroke and now hearing ALS. Heartbreaking."
118,2020-09-02,"My mum is 94. She is physically fit but dementia is speeding up. it's heartbreaking. She has a DNR for hospital. If she got COVID we wouldn't ask to extend her life but we would prefer she didn't die with crushed lungs, Mr Tony let's kill old people Abbott."
119,2020-09-02,My mother in law is in a facility in Washington state that has been on lockdown since March. She has had COVID and recovered. She has some dementia and wonders why none of her 8 children have been to she her. BARS AND RESTAURANTS ARE OPEN. WHY CANT MY WIFE SHE HER MOTHER.
120,2020-09-02,"Haven‚Äôt seen my mom of 95 since March . She‚Äôs had Covid, she‚Äôs recovered and she has Vascular dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs.Our elderly are being kept prisoners? Who are we supposed to be protecting?"
121,2020-09-02,"My girlfriend, a student from Poland has been away from her family due to covid and has helped me look after my mother who has dementia, she has smiled the entire time and kept me sane, I would love to do so many special things with the money as she deserves it #PrettyLittlePrize"
122,2020-09-02,My uncle died from dementia and was listed as a COVID death fuck off 
123,2020-09-02,"Incredible and very emotional thread Jazz. Now I guess I‚Äôll be adding my uncle to that sad drive thru, he died on Saturday in Detroit after a long battle with dementia and later covid. Thank you for sharing my brother.üôèüèæ"
124,2020-09-02,"My point being we can't blame others 4 our bodies falling victim to virus or genetics, eating habits, & other diseases. We want every moment with them, but if cognizent, I don't know of many terminal patients who would want ""Covid"" used on their death cert 4 dementia/tumor/etc"
125,2020-09-02,"Hi Amy, lost my mom to brain tumors from lung cancer 4 yrs ago & losing a parent mentally is horrific & sorry 4 ur loss. I wouldn't blame her death on Covid if infected by it. She was terminal anyway. Dimentia is terminal too but medicine won't rule it as such b/c it takes longer"
126,2020-09-02,My mother recently passed and her death cert listed Dementia/Covid. Please explain what you wonder about.
127,2020-09-02,"In every case, it was the COVID19 that cause the death, not the underlying condition. My dad passed because of pneumonia ""technically""--but it was dementia that really killed him. He forgot how to swallow, and that caused the pneumonia. COVID caused these deaths."
128,2020-09-02,"My cousin died last night, alone, in a nursing home. He had recovered from a covid hospitalization months ago, so I don't think covid is direct cause. However, the pandemic isolation/separation from family deprived him of hope, he slid deep into dementia, stopped eating, gave up."
129,2020-09-02,Thanks. I hope you do as well. I needed that. My gramma passed away Monday. She suffered from dementia and then tested poaitive for COVID. 24 hours later. She was 92. Much üíò
130,2020-09-02,"Thank you. Good to see this right now as my mother who has dementia is in the ER and I'm waiting on results from a rapid Covid test since she has a fever and cough. Can't go back to comfort her. So many in the same situation now, but when it's you it's still hard."
131,2020-09-02,"Thanks for your concern for the people who can‚Äôt make it to the polls, for caretakers who can‚Äôt leav their patients for a second, etc. Myself, well I have a daughter with Stage IV breast cancer, a husband with Dementia and I don‚Äôt riot or protest. I don‚Äôt want or deserve COVID-19"
132,2020-09-02,Hey! I am 73. My mom just passed from dementia and COVID-19. Can you keep your negative thoughts to yourself?
133,2020-09-02,"I‚Äôm so sorry Theresa! I feel your pain. While my mother has been lucky enough to not get COVID-19, she is in assisted living with dementia and her swift decline is unbearable some days. I get to see her at a distance, however I‚Äôm afraid she will die during this mess! üôèüèº for you"
134,2020-09-02,"My mom died in early May in a nursing home. She was 70. She had dementia. Due to her dementia she wasn't able to have a productive cough. A cold, flu, pneumonia, Covid all likely would have the same result."

137,2020-09-02,"Depends, is it my 84 year-old uncle with dementia or my 6 yr old niece? Because my niece has a higher chance of getting killed by lightning or space debris then by Covid. She has a much higher chance of dying of the flu. As for my uncle, he doesn‚Äôt live in Cuomo‚Äôs New York"
138,2020-09-02,"Thousands die from the following each year: Cancer, heart disease, flu, suicide, natural causes, and Dementia (to name a few.) Do we destroy the economy and close borders for any of these? Why is COVID any different? It has a survival rate of over 98% in Australia alone."
139,2020-09-02,"In the UK there are over 850,000 living with dementia, costing our economy ¬£26bn each year. People with dementia have been hit hardest by the pandemic, accounting for 1 in 4 COVID-19 deaths. It's clear that research into dementia is critical, now more than ever."
140,2020-09-02,"Sorry but no Sir. Reason for me, say NO TO THE MASK is that my mother passed away Aug 16 2020. She died from Dementia in Lexington KY she never had COVID-19. She was in Hospice for a week and there was nothing done for her that fell under any COVID-19 CARE. Reported COVID DEATH, WHY? "
141,2020-09-01,HC medpod work well amid covid-19. HC recovery from dementia  and  progress. Led drug war are occult  and  cut. Blasphemy bullshit!

142,2020-09-01,"PS: Personally interested in COVID prevention among folks that have dementia. A normal day can be difficult, adding the complexity of COVID is mindboggling. In our family we struggled to explain why wearing a mask was needed to my dad who has dementia. You're doing important work"
143,2020-09-01,"My dad who has dementia is in a nursing home, had to go briefly to hospital. Had slight temp so was put in Covid ward. This meant he‚Äôs had to be isolated in NH for 2 weeks. In a room. Alone. For 2 weeks. It‚Äôs inhumane. We need 2 learn to live with this virus"
144,2020-09-01,Chronic stress is honestly just my life even outside of COVID. I fully expect to get dementia if I make it to old age 
145,2020-09-01,Sir Superspreader. The Count of COVID-19. The Duke of Dementia. Lord of the Laughing Academy. Why is he still in office? üëπ
146,2020-09-01,"I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the CoVid Fatigue, remote learning school prep, having my darling demon children up my ass (FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, JUST EAT AN APPLE, I‚ÄôM TIRED OF FEEDING YOU PEOPLE) or just run-of-the-mill dementia, but I‚Äôm more shitshowy than usual lately."
147,2020-09-01,"Yeah. It was scary putting my Mum into a care home at the beginning of Covid, but she has made some dramatic improvements whilst she has been there. The experts are now saying that it‚Äôs not dementia but just old age. The effect still seems the same though.üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
148,2020-09-01,Meanwhile my 88 year old father who has zero understanding of ‚Äúon line‚Äù consultations can‚Äôt get a GP appointment so having survived lockdown and dementia isolation Covid-19 we will let him die anyway #Disgraceful
149,2020-09-01,The cdc has a table (in article I sent you) stating only 6% of deaths is Covid only. My grandfather suffered with dementia and multiple heart surgeries in past 2 years died in May they said Covid. Really? Nah it wasn‚Äôt Covid
150,2020-09-01,my Uncle had early onset dementia and died of Covid in a care home in may
151,2020-09-01,"We lost my father-in-law this morning. He died from Covid. I don‚Äôt care that he was old, had dementia and was in memory care. None of this is a reason to die in such a terrible way. Instead of dismissing these deaths, we should try to prevent them."
152,2020-09-01,"My Grandad went into respite care on Sunday. We were told he would have to self isolate until his covid test came back, this would take 24 hours. He's 92, partially sighted, and has vascular dementia and alzheimers. He still does not have his test results."
153,2020-09-01,"My brother goes to campus and in three days gets covid. We have immuno-compromised family members. So when you inevitabily shut your doors and he comes home, will you give a fuck if we all get covid? No. Will you care that I won‚Äôt be able to see my grandmother with dementia? No."
154,2020-09-01,It‚Äôs all ok for you to go without a mask and/or not social distance...until you get the virus or God forbid your loved one develops COVID and can not recover. #ImACaregiver #MyParent #Alzheimers #dementia #immunocompromised #FrontLineWorkersLiveHere #MaskUpMN
155,2020-09-01,"As a lay person, I‚Äôm concluding that in July 2020, out of the ten most common causes of death per 100,000, Alzheimer‚Äôs & Dementia was top with COVID-19 eighth. Assuming you‚Äôre an expert, feel free to correct any mistakes made with my interpretation of the data."
156,2020-09-01,"Yep. My 91 year old uncle with dementia. In VA nursing home. Hadn‚Äôt seen family in 5 weeks. Asymptotic. Covid on death certificate. No normal funeral. VA received $13,000. No one believes it was CV. Loneliness is a killer too."
157,2020-09-01,"I agree my dad died from covid. we're missing key issues re the public as a whole .we are assuming everyone understands information. With dementia my dad wouldn't know the guidelines. Live stream, or media. Info Reaching people effectively is vital. Never assume."
158,2020-09-01,To be fair to him @susannareid100 and @piersmorgan Covid was one of 3 things on my Dad's death certificate but I have seen no evidence of a test. He had dementia and was probably very confused and scared when we couldn't visit him in his care home.
159,2020-09-01,Quarter of Covid victims in England and Wales have dementia ‚Äì study. MyCognition research reveals link of #cognition to our immune system and inflammatory disorders like dementia. 
160,2020-09-01,"My grandmother REALLY believes a COVID vaccine will be just an excuse to implant a tracking chip into everyone. She told my mom this, so my mom said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre 88! Where are you going that you don‚Äôt want to be tracked?‚Äù Gram does not have dementia. She‚Äôs just been brainwashed."
161,2020-09-01,"If he is battling dementia, as televised speeches have shown, he will only decline if he Contracts covid 19. If he were my dad I'd never subject him to this political circus üò•üò™ God forgive his family."
162,2020-09-01,"My grandma died at 98 years from dementia, but she had also contracted #COVID19, a week before her death. So according to @GovInslee her death is from #COVID, not the disease that was taking her life slowly for the last 5 years. Our government is lying to destroy us."
163,2020-08-31,"My grandmother passed away today. I will not be streaming on @Twitch this evening. She had #dementia. But tested positive for COVID and was moved to an isolation unit in her nursing home. She passed away within 24-hours. I loved her, very much!"
164,2020-08-31,"Get us back into our loved ones in the care homes, my mum has aggressive dementia I‚Äôve not hugged her since lockdown. She‚Äôs dying of loneliness not covid same as all the other residents. They are human beings with feelings , let us in üò°"
165,2020-08-31,"My mom‚Äôs best friend died a few months ago -she had dementia and then had covid. My mom didn‚Äôt tell me, I found out from my sister."
166,2020-08-31,...while short-staffed because so many of them also contracted COVID? And my grandpa was in the dementia unit. How do you care for elderly patients w/out their full mental capacities in that situation? COVID killed my grandfather.
167,2020-08-31,My grandfather passed away in May. Suffered from dementia for over a year and had had 3 open heart surgeries in past 2 years. New Jersey considered him Covid death.

169,2020-08-31,My thought was more Person A with dementia gets 0.1% because they were going to pass away anyways. A person in their 30s with no prior sickness 95%-100% Etc. We add up all the different percentages and take the average over total deaths due to covid. What is the percentage?
170,2020-08-31,I know I've posted this before but I'm going to say it again. If there is a silver lining to covid it's insurance allowing telehealth visits for routine things. My Mom is 24 hr O2 and dementia. Doing her appointments for routine RX refills is so much easier with telehealth. üëçüëç
171,2020-08-31,Ur a sheep my aunt died of dementia had been giving 6 months to live prior to covid . She died was tested found to have covid listed as a covid death .

173,2020-08-31,Please pray that I can do what‚Äôs right for my mother‚Äôs fur baby. She has dementia and forgets everyone‚Äôs name but his. He is in his last few days and I can‚Äôt decide if I should put him to sleep and risk getting Covid and passing it to her or waiting for him to die at home.
174,2020-08-31,IKR to make matters worse every time I sneeze or blow my stuffy nose hubby freaks out the one thing that has sunk in past his dementia is the fear of covid so if I sneeze I get sprayed with Lysol it is almost funny he sneaks' up on me and sprays me üôÑ
175,2020-08-31,Totally understand. My mother had Alzheimer‚Äôs dementia and unfortunately passed away from COVID-19 in April. I was fortunate to have the support of Shuhala Abbas over the phone. We need more bilingual support in the community.

177,2020-08-31,"I have lost my job, I have lost loved ones who contracted this disease, and guess what? The virus didn't even affect her, she just died from her dementia around the time she got it. Still counted as a covid-19 death. I liked to joke it was 180,000-1 because I knew that wasn't why"
178,2020-08-31,2/ as being there. Just smells & flavors are missing But my 95yr old mom just went in2 a nursing home 4 dementia when Covid hit. I didn't have what it takes anymore 2 do all the things healthies demanded of me. Covid stopped that.They move as slow as me now üòèkindaüíûü¶†„ÄäCovid
179,2020-08-31,"You people are reassuring me. My mother also has dementia and I can't visit her since COVID, so I don't know what she thinks of all this. I am hoping she votes straight D based on lifelong habit."
180,2020-08-31,"Hardly anybody, including myself for my mother with dementia and now appears not to recognize me anymore. The rules are so restrictive for visiting. Still have to make appointments, not allowed on her floor, and be 6 ft apart with covid testing."
181,2020-08-31,"My grandmother is a resident at Sutton Park aged care facility due to her dementia. An outbreak started 3 weeks ago, residents were separated. An outbreak occurred in the ‚Äònon covid‚Äô half of the facility  and  residents were not moved. Now my grandmother has covid"
182,2020-08-30,"In sadder news, I went to visit my grandmother today and she doesn‚Äôt know me anymore. It‚Äôs cool, it‚Äôs fine. I knew it was coming. Covid sort of expedited the process. But fuck. Dementia is the worst."
183,2020-08-30,"My elderly Mum tested positive in day 22, it took her a while to recover and negatively affect her dementia long term, she still struggles with fatigue. Yes, she is elderly, yes she has other conditions, but also yes, Covid can last for over 28 days, especially in the elderly."
184,2020-08-30,"Well that and the fact that they included 20k heart attacks (with Covid) and 23k with Alzheimer‚Äôs and vascular dementia 14,053 had sepsis 7,415 had malignant neoplasms (cancer) And my favorite: 5,133 due to Intentional and unintentional injury, poisoning and other adverse events"
185,2020-08-30,"My Mom passed 5 days after her COVID positive test. She was a severe dementia patient. Nurses advised COVID ‚Äúattacked‚Äù her underlying condition. Honestly, I‚Äôm not sure what that means? If you‚Äôre accurate it would significantly improve the management of the virus. We need facts"
186,2020-08-30,My grandmother died of... ..i forget which cancer. My grandfather died younger than her.. one of my 12 aunts/uncles died at a young age from a heart attack.. and mom started displaying signs of dementia before covid/stroke killed her. Am I -completely- effed or..? Lmao..
187,2020-08-30,My grandfather died of dementia - never tested for COVID before or after death - and was classed as ‚Äúprobable COVID‚Äù on his death certificate. I‚Äôm not a conspiracist but some measure of this is nursing homes chasing $
188,2020-08-30,"I keep tweeting this: since testing began 328k covid cases found in the UK. Meaning 99.5% + of the UK are and always have been clear of covid. Only 160 cases in the whole of Wales where I live. Today I couldn‚Äôt hug my mum with dementia, this is madness. F#ck this hysteria."
189,2020-08-30,He is lucky Covid-19 hit because people would see the fact that he is suffering from dementia. My grandma had it. It's sad but he is not fit for the office.
190,2020-08-30,"Me and my husband are disabled, I am care giver of my mom with dementia, and our 14 yr old grand daughter who is currently healing over covid. Under quarantine. Bills piling up please help.$927rdc"
191,2020-08-30,I‚Äôm not saying COVID ain‚Äôt deadly but this is more in line with what I thought. My grandma had pneumonia and dementia and was already in hospice BEFORE she got corona but her death certificate strictly says Covid 
192,2020-08-30,How about that for some propaganda....both my grandma's died before covid. One from MS and one from dementia. Both conditions are being ignored now due to covid1984. #wontwearadamnmask
193,2020-08-30,"My mum is still in a dementia nursing home (only place able to cope with her neurological changes) 20 weeks post covid. She was sent home 8 weeks ago to be self-caring! No mental energy to eat, heat up meals, dress, she fell each day or maybe night due to confusion."
194,2020-08-30,Yay üôå. Ps my Dad has dementia and it‚Äôs tough during covid. I started off with simple aids like whiteboards and diaries while he was awaiting to be diagnosed. Hope you get some answers üíö
195,2020-08-30,So I shouldn‚Äôt care that my 88 year old patient with underlying conditions died of covid-19 because he was old? Despite the fact that he was doing okay before he got it.
196,2020-08-30,My friend made the doc take covid off as the cause of death. We couldn't get an answer from the NH as to why they even tested her. Death cert now says complications of dementia. She WOULDN'T still be alive regardless of covid.
197,2020-08-30,My sister in law is a nurse and they‚Äôve had no covid patients for 3 months and my Aunty is in a dementia home and they‚Äôve had one person die with health conditions and was tested positive for covid so they tested every one of them for covid and no one had the deadliest ever virus
198,2020-08-30,My Dad is an 85 year old with Dementia and COPD..He has been in quarantine in a nursing facility since March..He was tested 2 weeks ago positive for COVID with a 102 fever..He has since made a full recovery..This is all BS.Isolated with masks..Still got it and recovered..

200,2020-08-30,"My mother's friend, a couple she has known since childhood, 85 years, had dementia, advanced parkinsons and was put down as a covid death in a care home with no test. Furthermore the carehome banned an ipad for facetime calls @MattHancock"
201,2020-08-30,I find the drastic increase in deaths from dementia and Alzheimer's displayed on this chart to be quite interesting. My grandfather has dementia and also happened to catch Covid. He was successfully treated with medication though and is doing just fine now.
202,2020-08-30,I am looking after sick person with dementia because of covid and am restricted in what I can do because of it. I also have medical student in my family who can‚Äôt do extra volunteering because of our having sick person here.
203,2020-08-29,yes and dementia patients in the local bupa are in a different area which has had ZERO covid patients according to my source.
204,2020-08-29,"COVID? How long will he use that excuse? Most American know he's afraid to go outside and meet voters. And we all know why. My term is dementia flare-up. If you feel better, we'll just call it full on dementia. Is that better? : )"
205,2020-08-29,"GOD SO TRUE. I talked with a doctor for less than 2 minutes, and my main reason for my depression is fear my parents are getting very old (covid worries me),  and  I have no support ( and  for related dementia). Of course, dr was in a bad mood, and that somehow = fear of abandonment. ok?"
206,2020-08-29,"If you have a vulnerable family member on Medicare, don't take them to Mountain View. Got my Dad back full of holes, 10 pounds less, ran all kinds of expensive tests for three days. They discharged him as a covid patient, even though he tested negative. He also has dementia"
207,2020-08-29,Dealing with Alzheimer's or dementia in any form is stressful during normal times. Add COVID and it's off the charts stress for those who watch. People are cruel! Glad my mother finally agreed to let my daddy come home from the COVID nursing home and hired in-home care. It's hell
208,2020-08-29,"I was campaigning sometimes right up to, and prob beyond law, in 90‚Äôs over C Change. Nothing‚Äôs changed, but Covid (and my dementia) has shown me you can‚Äôt see into next year let alone 2050, so afraid C Change less important now.."
209,2020-08-29,"my dad‚Äôs said ‚Äúdementia, failure to thrive‚Äù but so many others like my mom‚Äôs only say the most immediate acute causes of death like sepsis or pneumonia. Bet many now will only say COVID."
210,2020-08-29,"And if this year can‚Äôt get worse enough, my Papa(stepgrandpa...my stepdad‚Äôs dad) is in the hospital with COVID-19 üòë He‚Äôs not in critical condition, but right now he has a high fever... and since he‚Äôs in the beginning stages of dementia.... that worries me even more üòî"

212,2020-08-29,My brother in law died 4 weeks ago from sever dementia in his 70s they put it down to covid even though for months he wasn't eating or drinking properly and was literally skin and bone when he died . Also how many people have died from flu this year all over the world
213,2020-08-29,"My mum had he flu jab last year. The next day she was given 24 hours to live, months later she ends up with covid 19. I refused her to go to the hospital, 3 days later she‚Äôs good, with one working lung, 10% mortality, dementia and a Aaa, this deadly virus couldn‚Äôt take her out!"
214,2020-08-29,"Before I log off for a weekend of R&Rs and IRBs, gotta say all I want to do in life is work to change the reality of dementia I truly abhor the distraction  and  devastation of racism in all its forms (covid, policing). It can't have my work. And it absolutely can't have my silence."

217,2020-08-29,Denise you are my current poster girl for common sense. My mother cannot get care support as she does not currently have a dementia diagnosis because all her appointments have been cancelled since March. There have been no Covid deaths in the local hospital for weeks
218,2020-08-29,"So... my mom? Ha who has liver damage, ovarian cancer, dementia, and broke both of her femurs in June due to osteoporosis. She can survive Covid"
219,2020-08-29,"Maybe 9, Oregon then reopen and dropped, sacrificed since March 85 & 72, thanks to all the selfish people my husband will likely die under Covid , not because of it, Dementia and other health issues"
220,2020-08-29,As far as I know dementia hasn‚Äôt happened to any of my family. We get killed by various unrelated ailments. In my mums case Covid 19 unfortunately. Wrong place at the wrong time.
221,2020-08-29,"My friend‚Äôs grandad died at 92, been ill for a good couple of yrs, lungs full of fluid, dementia, incontinence.... had Covid as cause of death on his certificate.

222,2020-08-29,"I know of 7 or 8 people that have died from heart attacks, strokes , old age etc and Covid has been blamed for all. My next door neighbour died recently, she had severe dementia, never went out of the house for 10 years, guess what? She died from Covid. You are being lied to"

228,2020-08-28,"Most people who die from a multitude of conditions like my father who was frail, elderly and had vascular dementia also succumb to pneumonia in last few days of life. I believe this is now being classified as Covid especially as deaths mentioning pneumonia are well down."

231,2020-08-28,My heart goes out to you. Coping with a loved one's dementia is difficult  and  heartbreaking enough. I can't imagine how hard it must be in the time of COVID.
232,2020-08-28,"She still has her green card. I was starting the citizenship process in February but covid. My dad was caring for her until he passed away 2 years ago and I have been trying to juggle 93 yr old with dementia (needs 24/7 care) , my husband and kids and our business."
233,2020-08-28,"I really need some help. I have my mom with dementia who I take care of. And two years ago I was diagnosed with a chronic lung condition that causes constant shortness of breath and cough. This puts me as high risk for covid 19 complications. And then my life line ,my car breaks. "

248,2020-08-26,"I LOVE my job (outside of covid), but I absolute hate it right now and have lost all motivation to oversee a dementia ward. I just wanna steal their insulin and inject it under my toenail."
249,2020-08-26,"Honestly wearing a mask & taking precautions for covid really don‚Äôt matter that much to me . It doesn‚Äôt ruin my day, but you know what does ruin my day .

259,2020-08-26,"Today I'm going to see my 86 year old Mum who has severe dementia. She will try to hug me. She will try to hug my Dad. She will be restrained by care workers. She will not understand why. Given covid 19 is now a very niche minority disease indeed, I don't understand why either."

266,2020-08-25,My mom was just like this. Her life spiraled down with no one able to lift her up. F you Covid for locking her away so her children and grandchildren can not see her... as her dementia shreds the last bit of memory she has while locked away to rot alone.

272,2020-08-25,This is literally every white chick nursing major I knew from school on their snap stories. Meanwhile my mom hasn‚Äôt been able to see my grandma with accelerating dementia since April because staff have gotten covid. 
273,2020-08-25,"I've never struggled as much as I have this summer. COVID, my mom diagnosed with dementia, knee surgery, and politics that divide us. I'm looking forward to my favorite sweatshirt and cool, cloudy days where I can curl up with a book and not feel guilt."
274,2020-08-25,"So this came as somewhat of a surprise, I say somewhat because she already had dementia. All of this said, I‚Äôm not here to get pity or condolences, but rather to ask you to please wear a mask. If not to keep yourself safe, but to keep my loved ones safe. #COVID__19"
275,2020-08-25,"And if there Dr puts them on a vent as ""treatment."" They are killing them. Not Covid. Just because people have JOBS don't make them good at it.. My grandmother is 87 with full term dementia, in a nursing home. Made Covid look like a cold for 5 days.. NEVER SEEN HER EAT FAST FOOD."
276,2020-08-25,"My mother who had vascular dementia lived in a care home. On 31/3 she passed away. They (care home) told my sister they thought it was Covid, death cert said pneumonia."

281,2020-08-25,My father passed away and they said it was because of Covid. Actually no he did not die of that he died because he had dementia and contracted a infection and they could not control it. So it is bullshit adding him as a number. That‚Äôs how it works people.
282,2020-08-25,My dad with dementia would really benifit from having his wife and kids providing love and support at his bedside before the last bit of his memory of us is gone. He was admitted 3days before the lockdown for COVID started. The guilt and pain my mom has experienced is horrendous.

286,2020-08-24,"So many false recordings of covid deaths. When my mam passed away in February she had a temperature of 41 degrees, that would definitely have been assumed covid now. It wasn't it was end of life dementia. How many others have been wrongly reported covid??"
287,2020-08-24,"Thank you for this, I warms my heart a little during this awful time. I visited my Mom today, only the 4th time since March. She no longer recognizes me or my Dad. COVID has many victims, lack of stimulation, fam visits, love, cause rapid decline w dementia"

293,2020-08-24,My heart! My mom is in late stage dementia right now. I can remember the first time she forgot my dad‚Äôs name. My gut still clenches at the thought. Most days she remembers me but I‚Äôm braced for the day she won‚Äôt and praying Covid will be past so I can hug her while she knows me.
294,2020-08-24,"Suspect it's true, my 92 yr old dad w #dementia was sent to a #COVID ward ""in error"", they tried to discharge as per 1 hr clinical discharge policy to care home he'd never been in, got him home  and  hospital had completed a #DNR without consulting mum or I."
295,2020-08-24,"Living it right now. Mom had a caregiver come by daily to tend to her needs, then Covid situation. Caregiver suddenly became a homeschooling mom, and I had to move my mom here (80 miles between our homes). It's not easy, but she seems good with body, not her dimentia. üòøüòøüòø"

299,2020-08-24,"My mother in law died of pneumonia, covid, dementia. So you point is? I take it you didn't die from it? We have a serious issue when we have a deadly virus that has a 99% SURVIVAL rate and people need testing to tell they have got it. That is the point."
300,2020-08-24,"OK, my job is with dementia/COVID patients  and  my husband has mild cognitive impairment so I feel trapped in two worlds. He won't take meds or get thoroughly tested. Sometimes he gets really angry  and  unnecessarily mean, I know it's his brain but I am still sad bc I am #powerless"
301,2020-08-24,My 94yr old mam went from hospital into a care home just as lockdown occurred. She quickly picked COVID. Fortunately she survived. Her dementia is worsening and I can only see her 20/30 mins every 7/8 days. I‚Äôm struggling with the anguish this is causing.
302,2020-08-24,To be fair it was going on long before Covid-19 rubbish. We had a relentless nurse telling us to sign a DNR for my mother in law after she had a fall and ended up in hospital. Why? Because she has dementia. They have been told for years to push push push the DNR agenda.

304,2020-08-24,Bringing jobs back to the US resulting in a strong stock market at least until Covid hit. Everything else very questionable at best. On the other side you have a man who very possibly has the makings of dementia. So here‚Äôs my vote in November 
305,2020-08-24,That's the sad part. My dad is 85. He has dementia. I refuse to send him to the hospital when he starts feeling bad. I always find a way to make him feel better. I be damed to let his death go down as covid. I'm smarter than that.
306,2020-08-24,We made it a point that my moms death did not reflect Covid. She was 92 had dementia and wasn‚Äôt sick.
307,2020-08-23,"My mother at 87 with dementia, would still be working during covid. She's not a coward, doesn't beg for help, and does what needs to be done. She's proud, stands for what right and is unapologetic about her beliefs. I couldn't get her to stop working if I tried."
308,2020-08-23,"My friend's grandma with dementia tested positive, recovered, tested negative, died and was counted as our second covid death. Her dr and her death certificate said it wasn't covid. Doesn't matter. This is in Illinois."
309,2020-08-23,Great weekend to see my mum - first time since March - lots happened since then - not only covid lockdown but my mum has also had to cope with my dad moving dementia homes. Lovely to see her and the kids also enjoyed seeing grandma üëµ

He told me, my mum with dementia  and  the packed class, plenty of veggies  and  30 mins exercise. Could help me lose the #Covid stone! "
313,2020-08-23,"My Mum is in Aged Care and so far ok. She is not physically ill, she has dementia. If she dies from Covid will they say it is a lie and she ‚Äúwould have died anyway‚Äù? I want to hug her sooner rather than later - WEAR A BLOODY MASK AND STAY HOME!"
314,2020-08-23,"Unfortunately, my experience hasn't been the best when contacting agencies. A neighbor has early stages of dementia and was wandering around approaching people without mask, zero clue as to Covid. Called to see if cops could do a wellness check..."
315,2020-08-23,Fuckin' covid-induced locked up in my goddamn house with my goddamn mother dementia is how I fuckin' explain it.

318,2020-08-22,I know how you feel Dan. Saw my mom yesterday. She has Parkinson's and dementia. Its only been a month since these PD visits were allowed. Her home has had ZERO COVID-19 cases and it's worth the wait. This is a marathon not a sprint....Hope you and yours stay safe and healthy 
319,2020-08-22,Which 86% of those diagnosed die inside Steve. The old method is a joke. With the old method my grandad who was diagnosed with covid but recovered inside two days would be a covid death if he died of his dementia ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
320,2020-08-22,It‚Äôs really really difficult. Along with the patient not knowing who you are so trying to establish good rapport through a computer/tablet is no bueno. I was forced to do it with that population because COVID had spread like wildfire through my one dementia care facility.
321,2020-08-22,"Na√Øve. Everyone ""needs to die"" eventually. My mate Gunnar died Covid+. He's been suffering severe dementia past two years. Unable to speak, very frail. His passing was inevitable, sooner rather than later. Look at the age profiles."
322,2020-08-22,My director swore we wouldn‚Äôt have more than 8 Covid patients on the hall. And that they‚Äôd all only require minor care. Well that was a big fucking lie. Got 9 people with dementia running up and down the hall and tryna get out of bed. Fantastic.

399,2020-08-18,"You're absolutely right. When my mom mom's sister died, they marked it as a covid death, even though she'd been in hospice for YEARS with severe dementia. Yeah I'm sure that had nothing to do with her death. The numbers are UNBELIEVABLY skewed. I'm sick of it."
400,2020-08-18,My grandfather is deaf & has mild dementia  and  isn't allowed away from his living facility due to COVID. Only way I can show him I love him  and  that he's not forgotten is by mail.

401,2020-08-18,"The hardest thing right now is that, due to the risk of COVID, he can‚Äôt have visitors, so you have an 89 year old with dementia who is sad and lonely because his family can‚Äôt visit him and he doesn‚Äôt understand why.

406,2020-08-17,Last night my great grandma passed away due to Covid. She had terrible dementia that worsened over the last few years  and  unfortunately led to her not remembering most of us. Thankfully she is at peace now in a better place  and  not suffering anymore. R.I.P Mama Ligi.
407,2020-08-17,My heart is full of love and gratitude. Just returned from visiting with my 92 year old Mom for the first time in 5 months.

412,2020-08-17,my dear mum lived several years in her late 80s with dementia till age of 92. It was difficult at times. I can not imagine mum having Covid too. so sad. thoughts with you and the family. - one day at a time. each day different.

415,2020-08-17,My Mom who has dementia was evacuated from her nursing home and was sick with a moderate case of COVID for 3 weeks in a hospital. She survived and is in a facility 2 hours away. I have been able to zoom visit. She does not interact. I am afraid she will not remember me too.
416,2020-08-17,"My aunt, who's in her 80s, also contracted COVID-19. She has diabetes and dementia. She was in a nursing home in Harris County, TX, when she fell ill. She almost died, but is now in a nursing home in Austin. Please wear a mask."

418,2020-08-17,"Just got a phone call from my sister. She cares for my grandmother as she has dementia and heart problems. My grandma woke up with a high fever, and refuses to eat or drink. They are giving my grandmother two weeks. üò≠ I can't go see her one last time. Damn Covid!!"
419,2020-08-17,"I‚Äôd really like to know, too. They‚Äôre being so damn quiet about it. If it was a heart attack they‚Äôd just say so. My guess: COVID or advanced dementia-related illness."
420,2020-08-17,"In terms of dementia, my grandmother died with it, so I know a bit about it. It can run in families, it can happen from lifestyle (eg obesity), it can be idiopathic (ie from outta the blue) or a number of other reasons. COVID is largely preventable; dementia largely is not."
421,2020-08-16,An asshole. I would have paid money to be with my Dad when he died from Covid in a Veteran‚Äôs Home living with dementia in April. Instead he died alone.

424,2020-08-16,My mother had vascular dementia for decades ( brain bleeds) but she tested positive for Covid and within two weeks was dead. She suffocated to death from Covid. One Dx does not rule out Covid as a cause.
425,2020-08-16,Ah I am so sorry to hear that. COVID is especially tough on people with dementia. My thoughts are with your family.
426,2020-08-16,"This precious 92 year old just contracted COVID. She suffers from severe dementia causing her to be scared and confused, already suffered from heat attack and other issues, and now is in isolation. She's also my last grandparent. I'm scared. "

561,2020-08-10,I believe that it could be the form of dementia that is eating his tiny brain. My dad has it and walking became so difficult because of the Parkinson‚Äôs that he has to use a wheelchair. No he is in hospice dying from Covid. I hope dementia takes 45 quickly. Maybe a nice fall.
562,2020-08-09,I figured out why I‚Äôm in such a bad mood. I wanted to take a road trip this summer but Covid made it impossible. My brother and his wife just took a 4-state drive to see their new grand baby. I‚Äôm home following the rules. My husband‚Äôs dementia will make it impossible next year.
563,2020-08-09,My sister and immune compromised niece and her husband were all exposed to COVID last weekend by his sister and her husband. They insisted on moving his mother(dementia) to a new facility near them after her husband died and have now exposed everyone by showing up sick.

570,2020-08-09,"I'm afraid I've had to do that in the past too, my only relief is that mum passed away before the current situation with Covid. Dementia is often worse for the family than the patient."
571,2020-08-09,"Welp, just potentially exposed myself to COVID while rescuing an ancient, hostile chihuahua w dementia (named Chambord) who was wandering down a busy street. Honestly, that‚Äôs üíØ on brand for me...*sigh*"
572,2020-08-09,Well- there will be a continuation of the ongoing surge in dementia going forward but Covid infections only play a bit part in that. The real epidemic in my opinion is aluminum poisoning of mitochondria which worsens everything- including dementia.
573,2020-08-09,"I learned how to make sourdough bread while recovering from COVID. Then I gained 15 pounds from all the bread I was eating. My bread stress eating was out of fear trying to keep my Seniors with Dementia COVID free. I'm on Twitter less, but still support Bernie  and  Dem Socialism. "

577,2020-08-09,Dementia is tough. The Nursing Facilities are Covid factories. I am thinking they are better now than last spring though. I live in an increasingly annoying area and have been thinking of moving but I worry about leaving my Dad w her 24/7. I was thinking about hospice care.
578,2020-08-09,You‚Äôre so wrong. My mom died on 7/26 (not from Covid)  and  I posted a tweet  and  on FBk. She had been suffering for a long time (dementia  and  physical pain). It hasn‚Äôt hit me yet that I will never see her again. Maybe on 8/14 (the 24th anniv. of my baby‚Äôs death) I will sob.

582,2020-08-09,"I‚Äôve been having a ton of issues lately in my personal life, and a covid outbreak in my grandpas dementia facility right after my grandma visited him for the first time in months is just the icing on the cake, truly üôÉüôÉüôÉüôÉ"
583,2020-08-09,Never said that. My grandmother recovered from COVID at her nursing home in May. She also recovered from pneumonia in April. She has dementia. But the issue is staff and traveling doctors were in and out on a regular basis. They caused this at her place.
584,2020-08-08,My grandmother went into a nursing home with dementia and wasn't eating. 2 days later after being put in there she died of covid. That nursing home is being investigated guess who the governor is? Massachusetts.

588,2020-08-08,Balancing risks of covid to my grandparents vs risks to their mental  and  physical health by staying home is making me cry. They‚Äôre 88  and  89 and he has dementia. This virus has taken the last of his independence. Weighing up how to best keep them safe  and  happy is bloody hard.
589,2020-08-08,"My mother in law died of covid, pneumonia and dementia. Now bear in mind she has been ill for years. So did covid kill her?"
590,2020-08-08,Trying to change my sis's tests in hospital & Dr.'s appt last week bc I refused to take her in & leave her alone. I also refuse to go to the hospital. Dementia is incurable so 6 mo is not a huge wait. Losing either of us to covid is too much when we're already fighting daily.
591,2020-08-08,"10 years ago, my mom and uncle could go see grandma... but now they can't because of covid. They're even more sure since she had dementia and more and... honestly I'm not even sure how I can even help my mom other than letting her cry."

595,2020-08-08,"My best friend worked on the Covid ward at my local hospital. It was used! But a man I know has Covid 19 on his death certificate. He was never tested. He had dementia. He had a cough before he died, that was it."
596,2020-08-08,"my grandpa had surgery in early july and has been in a care facility, away from home, recovering for over a month now. no one has been allowed to visit him due to COVID guidelines, and he‚Äôs hard of hearing and has dementia. my dad stands outside of his window and waves at him"
597,2020-08-08,"This will be me (my mom), in a couple of weeks... hospice. Not COVID. CHF  and  Dementia. 84. I‚Äôm sorry for your loss and pain, I hope it is a relief from suffering, and she was able to journey in peace. I can‚Äôt imagine, but it is coming. Peace."
598,2020-08-08,As for meüá®üá¶ one of my concerns is how the Covid-19 vaccine will affect children going into their old age? In what capacity will it weaken them? It could cause Dementia for all anyone knows. How can we know in 30 or 40 years what will happen. Maybe it will shorten life spans.
599,2020-08-08,"I‚Äôm so sorry, my mom had dementia, it rbs people of their personhood. I pray she recovers from covid."
600,2020-08-07,"2/ severely restrict visits. While COVID FREE for over 3 months, NH denied ANY outdoor distanced visits in fenced courtyard. NH sometimes denied even window visits, while also incensed that masks not always worn outside of CLOSED window. Which is NONSENSE. My parent with dementia"
601,2020-08-07,"My father was in hospital for 5 weeks (not covid) arrived home today. Supposed to have home care. Home care doesn't come for a week. I'm supposed to help with bathroom, dressing, put in and out of wheelchair. All on my own. He has dementia, too week to walk. So scared"
602,2020-08-07,"My mom, definitely affected by COVID 19 seclusion. She doesn‚Äôt remember her own family. She has dementia. Please pray for her. The Democrats should be real proud. I think of all those who died ALONE. China is responsible. All these politicians who defend business with them. "
603,2020-08-07,Wild how significant of a life event COVID is gonna end up being for us. Going to be hilarious when I have dementia in 50 years and can‚Äôt remember my wife‚Äôs name but know to wear a mask when I leave my room in the nursing home
604,2020-08-07,"Listened to you on KFI back in the late-90s. Genius. My dad is in a dementia facility in NorCal - COVID case was found in facility, isolated, and they've protected the residents. The isolation is hard, but alternative is death. I am grateful for competence  and  science."
605,2020-08-07,My thought too. I actually thought he licked a doorknob at a covid ward so he‚Äôd get the Virus and then be excused from seeing that slobbering orange flop sweating dementia patient.
606,2020-08-07,"My dad just got taken to hospital by ambulance bc he was screaming in pain trying to get out of bed this morning.

608,2020-08-07,"My very good friend lost his uncle to covid in May, he had dementia though. My mate also has 2 kids and a massive mortgage to pay. He can‚Äôt afford to have things shut down any longer and he hates masks and will not social distance. Hope this partly answers ur question."
609,2020-08-07,"the moment covid restrictions hit, my senile dementia-addled mother said she smelled a rat."
610,2020-08-07,Dementia is terrible. I think it's harder on the family than person having it. Some nursing homes got hit hard it's ridiculous to think that some people thought it was a good idea to put Covid patients in nursing homes. They did in PA but not in my area.

644,2020-08-05,It made me so sad today to hear that at the end of his life dementia made John forget all the good he had done and how much he was loved and because of Covid people couldn‚Äôt visit him in the care home. He didn‚Äôt deserve that. It broke my heart. He was my hero
645,2020-08-05,He‚Äôs fortunate to have his buddy to visit ...my mom passed of dementia and my 97 y.o. Aunt (Altzeimers) in SC. assisted living has fading long term memory (no Covid). Your friend looks very well cared for...üôè‚ù§Ô∏èüëç
646,2020-08-05,My mum passed almost 2 weeks ago after a big fight with dementia and Covid. 2020 needs a kick in the soft bits.
647,2020-08-05,My clients with #Dementia and #Alzheimers have been the most enlightening and the most heartbreaking. Covid has put the focus on them. It's time to act and not again turn away from the mayhem these diseases can cause. Empathy and compassion are required along with science. 
648,2020-08-05,"Aside from that, my grandpa (in nursing home) hasn‚Äôt seen anyone he knows for a month now because of the rise in COVID. No visitors allowed, which is smart. But I wish people knew how devastating that is, especially for a man with dementia. This is why we are concerned."
649,2020-08-05,"Finally, we don't know each other so I am comfortable saying this: my mother has Covid. I hope she dies. Why? She has advanced Parkinson's and is in the last stage of dementia. Now at the hospital, she was locked in a room within a sr. facility since March. It's no way to live."
650,2020-08-05,Dear Matt Hancock Dementia is an awful disease My mother has Dementia Got COVID-19 care home Was kept in room for three weeks Survived But confused and distressed You did that Inhumane @MattHancock #borishasfailedtheuk #dementia 
651,2020-08-05,Daisy it is hard. My mother died in a care home during lockdown. Not Covid but late stage dementia I had not been allowed to see her for 3 months. Still feel sad about it and she died in May. My thoughts are with you at this trying time for you. 
652,2020-08-05,"What a lovely story. My dad passed away from dementia shortly before COVID, but I‚Äôd like to think if he were still here, he‚Äôd have a staff that cared for him like this."
653,2020-08-05,"Well my grandpa died today (not from covid). He had dementia, suffered a heart attack and now he‚Äôs gone. I‚Äôm relieved he‚Äôs no longer suffering"
654,2020-08-04,"I feel you, Matt. My mom passed from dementia in February. As hard as that is, I consider it a grave that it was before COVID. Besides, she with the One Who never forgot her no matter how much she forgot. Praying for y‚Äôall."
655,2020-08-04,"I know of 3 people who allegedly died with covid. All in care homes, 2 with dementia 3rd was 96. I know lots of people myself included who think we had it December/January/February. All still alive."
656,2020-08-04,"Stressed........the assumption is you live near the hospital but I DON'T. It's a 2 hour drive away. They ""lost"" my mum last time she was in. But she is an elderly dementia patient so why should they care. The hospital and local area is rife with covid, can you tell I am cross?"
657,2020-08-04,"Yeah, I told you, I think, She's my mom has Dementia. I can't leave to go to the hospital even if I wanted to. I don't want to expose her, she doesn't grasp Covid, at all. She had my Dad's ballot too. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èWe found it, but üò´ She's does know 45 an asshole."
658,2020-08-04,My Dad passed away in June. His cause of death was dementia and the frailty of old age. The doctor who completed the paperwork also noted the prostate cancer that he recovered from about 10 years ago. Its possible Covid is being reported even if not the primary cause of death.
659,2020-08-04,My mom-in-law has dementia. Not being able to go see her due to COVID-19 has been awful and she can‚Äôt manage a video conference. 25 deaths there due to COVID. Impossible to maintain social distance with a dementia patient. What a horrible disease. üò•
660,2020-08-04,"my folks just had to put my uncle w/ dementia in a home, and then he has to go 2 weeks with no visitors b/c of covid, all the while not really remembering why he's there so uh. maybe when describing the Prez we use words like ""hateful"" and ""incompetent"" instead of ""senile,"" yeah?"
661,2020-08-04,"I know that has to be painful. I've lost both parents, my oldest sister and all of my aunts and uncles. My last aunt, who also suffered from dementia, recently passed after catching COVID in a nursing home."
662,2020-08-04,"Just found out one of my closest friends has Covid. Yesterday, another friend‚Äîwho has cancer, btw‚Äîwas telling me how hard it‚Äôs been not being able to visit her mother at her nursing home. Her mother has dementia and doesn‚Äôt understand why no one has visited her. She‚Äôs lonely."
663,2020-08-04,Found out my Granddad has Covid on Sunday. And his dementia is advancing rapidly. He was taken to the hospital yesterday. I‚Äôm trying to be at peace with whatever happens... but I really hope a miracle happens.
664,2020-08-04,Wondering why my 96 y.o. client (with dementia) just rec‚Äôd his second $1200 #Covid check from the Federal Government? Yesterday I read that it hadn‚Äôt yet been approved by the Senate. Anyone else get one? @SenSchumer
665,2020-08-04,"How dare you. My grandfather died of COVID-19. He'd survived 106 years, 12 of them battling prostate and bowel cancer, dementia, and coronary artery disease, only to be taken by this awful new disease. How very dare you."
666,2020-08-04,"At first, I genuinely thought this was a comedy spoof, then to my horror I realised it was a genuine interview......seriously, someone help this confused, dementia afflicted old man into a care home.....oh, and take his finger off the nuclear button in case he tries to nuke Covid "
667,2020-08-04,Been on the floor the past 18 months pre Covid care taking for my covert narcissist mom with dementia. Yes my millions are coming üôèüèøüíµ
668,2020-08-04,"Hey y‚Äôall, it looks like my 93 year old Abuela is going to survive Covid. Sadly, she‚Äôll never have the life she had before. She can‚Äôt walk anymore, can‚Äôt eat solids, she has a much more pronounced dimentia. But she survived. And I‚Äôm so grateful we‚Äôll live to see each other again."
669,2020-08-04,"epiphany breaks my heart because the last time I saw my grandma (after her struggle with dementia, COVID and sudden cancer) was in a hospital room where I held her hand through plastic. I had 15 final minutes with her and I miss her so, so much."
670,2020-08-03,"Can you say delusional? My mom had Covid, she‚Äôs down to 78 pounds and has almost total dementia now. She‚Äôs recovered but will never be the same. "
671,2020-08-03,My grandma is in her mid 90's and has no idea what covid is bc of her dementia. Were lucky enough that my aunt works there so she can at least see her and give us updates. Its sad that they're basically prisoners because of how at risk they are.
672,2020-08-03,"It's the long goodbye, my Mom has dementia, it's so difficult to see her struggling to remember me..It's so difficult on my Dad, now with Covid, visiting is so restricted. My prayers to you Zack, and your family. Music always brings smiles, play his favorites"
673,2020-08-03,Hearing that some of my friends (in their 80s with dementia) tested positive for covid makes me want to slap every person in Alabama that isn‚Äôt wearing a mask
674,2020-08-03,"It‚Äôs strange. I had this conversation tonight. My mum‚Äôs 92 year old aunt with dementia had covid quite a few weeks back but had recovered with no lasting effects. Anyway, she sadly passed away last week and covid was ‚Äòcause of death‚Äô."
675,2020-08-03,My MIL has dementia. She lived with my SIL until she slid onto the floor. Took the ambos to get her upright. She is now in an excellent NFP home close to my SIL. No COVID but restricted visiting keeping them safe.

677,2020-08-03,"Well, that was strange. Finally managed to convince my Dad it's safe for him to get up. Somehow he'd got it into his head he has Covid-19. He was worried he'd infect me with it if he got out of bed. Dementia works in funny little ways."
678,2020-08-03,I understand. My mum had dementia. She died in May due to COVID-19 but she was also unwell due to the dementia. It caused her to have seizures...
679,2020-08-03,Created an oasis in garden for mum with #dementia took her out for 1st time since Covid Her eyes were mesmerised by the butterflies ü¶ã and leaves üçÅ blowing in summer breeze She gazed in my eyes and gave the biggest smile üòä Truly magical moments @AlzResearchUK
680,2020-08-03,"As a family we cared for my Nan with her dementia for near 5 years, it got to the stage where we had no choice but to move her into a home, heartbreaking at the time, but it‚Äôs been amazing, sure during Covid it‚Äôs really sucked, but the care is superb, she has a social life now.."
681,2020-08-03,"My Dad is in a care home in Argentina (he's lived out there for over a decade, it wasn't an extreme measure) as he has dementia. He's being tested for COVID-19 as he's poorly. Hopefully it's nothing as they've had no visitors allowed, but still scary"
682,2020-08-03,I lost my mom to Covid in March...but she also had dementia...just be supportive...thats about all you can do. And say a prayer 
683,2020-08-03,Caring for a loved one with #dementia is tough. Add #COVID and it‚Äôs harder. I experienced it firsthand with my mom who has #Alzheimers. Read this blog about the instersection of 3 pandemics. We must address  and  invest to eliminate the disparities among people of color.
684,2020-08-03,"My mother-in-law was in a fabulous care facility. They locked down early and had no Covid. We didn‚Äôt see Nanna for 5 months and only saw her once before she died, from old age at 97. Mercifully her dementia made her unaware that we were not with her when she passed away in peace"
685,2020-08-03,"So sorry Karen. My mum is in care due to dementia  and  mobility issues  and  like so many of our elderly  and  most vulnerable people, caught covid. She has to everyone‚Äôs surprise got better. These tories as well as being cruel are also very stupid!"
686,2020-08-02,"This is so devastating. I‚Äôm so sorry. My 90 yo mother has dementia and is in a nursing home ‚Äî thankfully in Maine. No cases yet. I hope to see her in a few weeks (with a negative COVID test) ‚Äî for a few minutes, by appointment, outside, through a barrier. I can‚Äôt imagine, Kat."
687,2020-08-02,"I am a caregiver for my husband with dementia and now with COVID, I am letting only hospice in. It has been a long decade. There is no good outcome. My heart goes out to you and your husband"
688,2020-08-02,My mom has dementia and has broken her back twice. Thank goodness she was just released from the hospital in Palm Springs so she can go through hospice at home. We can't visit her because of COVID. This sucks.
689,2020-08-02,"Unbelievably crass and selfish. My poor nan had no choice. Thankfully at 95 she recovered from COVID, though it has accelerated her dementia. So her quality of life is worsening"
690,2020-08-02,"So my great grandmother who passed away recently due to old age, she was 96, suffering from dementia and a previous stroke, we just found out her death went down as a Covid death and she never tested positive. Yeah the numbers are extremely inflated"
691,2020-08-02,Thanks for advocating for the elderly. My mom has dementia and is in Assisted Living. I worry about her getting COVID. These seniors are truly the innocents. Many are from the greatest generation. So very sad. Please know that you did your best for your mom. üíïüôèüíï
692,2020-08-02,"This Tuesday I had a time set up to see my wife outside of her nursing home. 6 feet apart and with masks, somewhat of an improvement from looking at her through a window. She has dementia and no longer communicates. 2 hrs after got an email they have an employee covid+ ends all."
693,2020-08-02,"My Granny was almost 101 and had dementia pretty bad. She was in a home for the last few years but family visited her everyday before covid but she was always confused and it was so sad most days, I‚Äôm gonna miss her but I feel like she held on as long as she could üíï"
694,2020-08-02,the fact that i can‚Äôt be in the ICU with my grandma who has alzheimers & dimentia bc of covid really breaks my heart this year fucking sucks
695,2020-08-02,"CA has had the policy to make nursing home and senior facilities take Covid+ patients since March. My dads dementia, assisted living place was threatened with fines  and  closure because they asked to be exempt due to safety. It‚Äôs incredible. (Thankfully not asked, yet)"
696,2020-08-02,"I haven't been able to see my mom since 3/6/20 because the monster in chief fucked up covid response so bad, that we cannot go visit her in long term care (dementia). during this time, she lost her ability to answer the phone, and no longer recognizes us (her only children)"
697,2020-08-02,"My mother in law died from covid, dementia and pneumonia. So she is counted as a covid death. But has been ill for years. Covid just speeded her death up."
698,2020-08-02,Actually yes. My Mom who recently survive COVID-19 is proud that I am an independent thinker. I am a strong woman like her. My Dad died from dementia and loves me no matter what! It‚Äôs called parenting at its best!
699,2020-08-02,"My Mom died 3/30 as a byproduct of Covid. She had dementia and was bedridden at a nursing home. Once lockdown occurred  and  family couldn‚Äôt be there daily to encourage her to eat/drink, she went downhill fast. She wasn‚Äôt being taken care of there. I miss her every single minute."
700,2020-08-02,Mine was the relief I felt that my father-in-law had been hospitalized for his dementia and parkinson's since his wife who was still in cancer remission would have such a hard time caring for them both in quarantine. He died of COVID within 2 weeks.
701,2020-08-02,My husband passed away due to Covid-19 in a dementia care home in May at the age of 66. As he needed 24 hour nursing care we had no choice but to use a private care home. No matter where he lived he was entitled to the same NHS care as anyone else including testing.
702,2020-08-02,"Oh yes, higher than flu. And as you say, we have flu vaccines. Tbh - I know this is not a popular view - but I would not want to live in a home with dementia  and  swallow up my kid's inheritance. I'd much, much rather die of COVID than that."

707,2020-08-02,Do you have a link to this? I need it for my father‚Äîhe has Covid-19 associated dementia and it is causing an inability to appreciate the fictional quality of Carlson's narrative. The show should include a warning label.
708,2020-08-02,"Then we must CHOOSE to protect each other. People seem disappointed that more people aren‚Äôt DEAD. The virus has horrible long-term effects.

715,2020-08-01,"I have no interest in entering any hospital unless I have to because I care for 2 vulnerable people - my father has CLL, my grandmother has advanced dementia. I know other services have taken a hit. I still think the government is right to ""obsess"" over covid."
716,2020-08-01,When I received the phone call that my mom and all the dementia residents on her floor were infected with Covid I just knew she would die. Mom is 93 and all were mid 80‚Äôs to 97. All but 2 survived taking hydroxy chloroquine n a Z-Pak. I‚Äôm a believer.
717,2020-08-01,My mother in law passed away in December. She was in a nursing home with dementia. So thankful we did not need to navigate covid while she was with us. Dememtia is hard enough.

750,2020-07-30,"My brother also had Lewy Body dementia and after one of his incoherent ramblings, he always laughed at himself and made jokes about it - he knew it happened every time. He kept that sense of humor until the end. We were unable to have a funeral because of COVID. ü§¨"
751,2020-07-30,Open the damn nursing homes. What are you hiding? No briefings regarding the current Covid deaths. My father lost 25 lbs since your lockdown. Free the criminals and punish the elderly. We are having a GLASS VISIT like he‚Äôs a monkey. He‚Äôs full blown dementia.
752,2020-07-30,‚ÄúNo witness restrictions due to Covid-19‚Äù. So- my 87yr old Father in-law (registered voter) with dementia can easily submit his pre-filled ballot?
753,2020-07-30,My mother of 95 who suffered from dementia had a fall and broke her hip was taken to hospital and died two days later. She was tested for covid 19 before she died. Result was negative. They put covid 19 on death certificate. They will pay for this.
754,2020-07-30,Dementia friendly online programming allow people to engage where public transport  and  travelling to spaces may be a barrier. A hybrid approach of physical  and  online could be the way forward post-covid. Great insight from Amy  and  Marina from @MuseumofLondon @gem_heritage
755,2020-07-30,Actually my mother of 95 who suffered from dementia had a fall and broke her hip was taken to hospital and died two days later. She was tested for covid 19 before she died. Result was negative. They put covid 19 on death certificate.
756,2020-07-30,Bore da ! Bit of a struggle at the moment. My auntie who is 84 has #dementia and we have spent the last two days trying to work with social services to get her in a home as my uncle can‚Äôt cope anymore. Turns up homes can‚Äôt cope with dementia and people who can walk due to #covid
757,2020-07-30,I saw my mom for 24 hours before she died bc she was in the hospital and no visitors were allowed bc of covid. my grandpa has dementia and both him and my grandma are super susceptible to this virus. so forgive me if I want y‚Äôall to just WEAR A FUCKING MASK BRO
758,2020-07-30,"My Mom was in long-term care, with dementia and the building was closed when COVID rules started. I talked to her a few times on the phone and she still knew who I was and it killed me not to be able to see her. I never got to see her in person again; she died on June 23."
759,2020-07-30,"If the choice is take a chance with COVID-19 or dementia with the vaccine, I'll take my chances with COVID-19. "

761,2020-07-30,this boy going ask me why do my job got me working with people who go COVID ü•¥ like what yo ? i work in the health field who tf else going care for them and take care of residents with dementia
762,2020-07-30,"‚ÄúBoo hoo I broke the law and took my COVID-19 to QLD and now my pic is in the paper and I‚Äôm so ashamed‚Äù The dementia patients who are sitting in their own fecal matter, isolated from their loved ones, and also suffering from COVID-19, send their sympathy and best wishes."
763,2020-07-30,My fatherinlaw chose to go into aged care to look after his wife who has dementia. He doesn‚Äôt deserve to get covid just because he‚Äôs old. He‚Äôs a valuable member of our family removing some of the burden of caring for his wife. I loathe the mentality that old is better off dead.
764,2020-07-30,"I buried my grandpa last week, non covid related. Dimentia and alzhiemers got the best of him. Never felt so sad cause he and my grandma raised me when I was 3"
765,2020-07-29,"This Fed Gov makes me so Angry. My dads been neglected in Aged Care (only been there a wk) he was in üè• from a fall  and  broke his hip (suffers from dementia) He's fallen 3 X in their care  and  broke his hip again, operated  and  back in üè• Last night find out there's Covid at his Age Care"
766,2020-07-29,"I had to return to work on July 3rd. We‚Äôve had two confirmed cases of COVID-19 at my facility since then. My mother lives 700 miles away. She has dementia and it‚Äôs not safe to travel so, I can‚Äôt see her. It can always be worse. ‚òπÔ∏è"
767,2020-07-29,"My aunt, w dementia, in public facility. Looks like it‚Äôs furnished by an op shop but, the level of protection is outstanding during covid. She hasn‚Äôt left the building since March, very distressed, we think they have upped the meds to counter that but she is safe."
768,2020-07-29,"My uncle died from a fall just three weeks ago. Death certificate said, subarachnoid hemorrhage, dementia, Covid. Got counted. Asked for records, since, before death, there was no indication of Covid. He was 92 yrs. old."
769,2020-07-29,I hope my tweet hasn't frightened you. I've tweeted before about the positives. Mum has had a good dementia life. She is still fine. I just had a moment bcs Covid meant I couldn't gradually get used to this latest change plus the PPE + having to book to see her has made it hard.
770,2020-07-29,My mother has been an amazing caretaker for so many years to my Grandma who has dementia and can barely walk. But COVID is something new to her and 4 months of being stuck in a house is really changing everything.
771,2020-07-29,My uncle who died of dementia on his home had covid as cause of death. Such a disgrace how this became political
772,2020-07-29,"Difficult decision Anita; my F-I-L had to go in a Nursing Home last year with vascular dementia after my M-i-L found it too much caring 24/7  and  none of the family could provide enough support üò∞ He seems happy  and  settled now, despite having tested positive for COVID-19 in May ü§ó xx"
773,2020-07-29,Great article on the importance of touch for older people during the pandemic by my friend @KarenRennie12 #COVID__19 #dementia #LTC
774,2020-07-29,My brother inlaw they tried to send him to a care home with virus. He finally waS sent home to live with 72 y old wife and 96y old mother with dimentia with Covid. Fact 
775,2020-07-29,I've been there. My 84 yo father with dementia was done the same way. No comprehension of what was happening. In total fear. Whoever dreamed up this Covid hysteria needs a world of pain. God help me forgive. 
776,2020-07-29,My 98 year old mother had Covid in NJ independent care. I believe there have been a total of 38 cases with 9 deaths there.Moved her to Memory Care after she recovered. Lost weight and dementia worse but healthy now. NJ sends me the numbers weekly.Think they must. Wishing all well
777,2020-07-29,"My uncle was re-admitted to the ICU after much fighting with the hospital staff. Today, I received news that he is being released to hospice for end of life care. I guess the progressive dementia and COVID were just too much. üò•"
778,2020-07-29,Saw my mum today. Coming to terms with her advancing dementia is difficult. Before #Covid I could adapt gradually bcs I saw her so often. She has moments where she sort of slices through the fog and knows me and loves me. It takes me days to process my emotions after each visit.
779,2020-07-29,"Thank U. Me 2. I miss my dad. Sadly, I lost my mom even more recently to Covid. I could no longer have conversations w/her as she had dementia. I tell people to call your parents often, sit down  and  talk to them if U can. Listen to their stories, your family history. So precious."
780,2020-07-29,"He looks good! My granda has dementia, 3 trips to hospital while covid was going on....double pneumonia and sepsis were 2 of those. He‚Äôs come out the other end having tested negative throughout and I‚Äôm getting to enjoy some conversations about the olden days again!"
781,2020-07-29,Aging acceleration in our sedentary calorie-drop sleep-broken and consumption-based economy brings age-related dementia in relation to impaired immune system. Latter brings COVID susceptibility. Serious harms. 
782,2020-07-29,"Economy of consumption fuels metabesity, dementia, hyper-aging COVID-susceptibility, heart disease, major depression, and #ClimateChange - #deforestation #ocean-spoiling #species loss. Our sickfreak economy dies or humanity will We have to build an economy our kids can live with!"
783,2020-07-29,"Thinking of my mom, who‚Äôs been in a Quebec hospital, awaiting heart surgery for 3 weeks. Isolated & not permitted to return home to care for my dad with dementia. Surgery may take weeks  and  brings with it high risks in itself. #COVID  and  our response to it is impacting lives."
784,2020-07-29,"469 covid infections reported in nursing homes in Victoria today? Five of those, only, were in government-run homes. The rest were found in private, for profit-run nursing homes. Thank god my dad, who had dementia, was given a state -funded place at Wharparilla Lodge, Echuca."
785,2020-07-29,"We all know he is a known dummy and has dementia and the reason he is hiding is bc his handlers know if he gets covid, it‚Äôs goodnight Irene."
786,2020-07-29,"Thank you sugar ‚ô•Ô∏è she had dementia but the isolation of covid had just made her worse. Unfortunately she just stopped eating in the end. Then found out this morning her husband my uncle John has had a fall too, I‚Äôm guessing due to shock as he didn‚Äôt get to see her. Rough day üòï"
787,2020-07-29,My aunt 93 with dementia was admitted to hospital with a suspected broken hip. A week later she died. Covid on her birth certificate!! UK by the way!
788,2020-07-29,"Sorry to hear about your Dad. My father also died in a Care Home- from dementia (no covid in the home), death cert listed dementia as main cause, also other contributing factors. I suspect the issue you mention is a localised one, it's certainly not what I've experienced."
789,2020-07-29,Is that why my mother has to wait NINETEEN DAYS for her COVID test results so she can get in a memory care facility for onset dementia? Thank your fucking boss for me
790,2020-07-29,"thinking abt my gma with onset of dementia being on a paralytic bc she was fighting the nurses, she's scared and surrounded by people she doesn't know doing things to her that she doesn't understand in a place she's not familiar with and we can't even visit bc of covid"
791,2020-07-29,"That's fantastic. I'm in Canada. My poor mom has dementia and is stuck on a waiting list, helped not at all by the Covid-19 situation, and my Dad gets no help caring for her."
792,2020-07-28,"Would you please re-tweet my tweet about the intersection of three pandemics: COVID-19, dementia, and systemic racism?"
793,2020-07-28,"Earlier at his #presser, POTUS ventured a guess that ""it must be my personality,"" as to why Dr. Fauci is more well-liked then he. See? Even people with dementia have moments of clarity. #coronavirus #COVID19 #COVID"
794,2020-07-28,My grandmother passed in 2018 (dementia related)...I'm glad she's not here to see / battle this. Private Sector aged care is an absolute rort and needs a total overhaul once Covid allows. Let alone if you have a severe illness like dementia. Staff simply not trained or able.
795,2020-07-28,"Let's just agree then to disagree on a definition. Suicide, dementia, loneliness, people not getting medical help and people on the breadline because of the criminal controlled demolition of the economy - Lockdown damage and deaths far and away outstripping Covid deaths"
796,2020-07-28,"This is all too familiar. My grandmother has dementia and ever since COVID, she's suddenly become hostile, angry, and paranoid. Her mental health is slowly deteriorating and it's heart breaking to watch when there isn't much you can do "
797,2020-07-28,Just got off the phone w/ my 78 y/o sister who has dementia. She's crying b/c her husband of 60 yrs is dying of Covid. Not b/c she'll miss him or feels sad. B/c finally she is free of him  and  his abuse. Take home msg: Don't live your life w/ regrets. Live your life today! Now!
798,2020-07-28,"It has me especially anxious though because my mom has early onset dementia. Covid has prevented her from having an MRI, but she began developing dementia young and no one knows why yet. I don't know. I guess the testing is related to ASD, but part of me is still nervous."
799,2020-07-28,"I am so sorry, this must be draining you. Prayers that dad and mom get through this. My mom is 93 also has dementia, lives with me, not easy. My aunt (her sister) has worse dementia in a nursing home and is 96 and survived covid. Hang in there, take care of you too.üôèü§ó"

801,2020-07-28,"My mother, who survived breast cancer to die from effects of dementia, was not f*cking demons. Dad was an asshole at times, but I'd never go that far. Nevertheless, I know of someone who clearly is f*cking demons, and so does his new COVID doctor. "
802,2020-07-28,"Covid has taken my mother. She is in a personal care facility with dementia. It progressed so fast during the lockdown that she is delusional, she hallucinates and she doesn‚Äôt know who I am. And I can‚Äôt see her. Since March 13. "
803,2020-07-28,"My aunt just informed me that her MIL tested positive for covid... my aunt cares for my grandma who suffers from dementia and ALL I can think about is, my aunt possibly spreading it to my grandma. She is literally the weakest person I‚Äôve ever met. Praying hard."
804,2020-07-28,My neighbor with dementia just heard about COVID-19 for the first time again.
805,2020-07-28,"i'm so sorry i can't imagine how hard it is with someone with Alzheimer's, my mother has dementia, she's 97, and it's heartbreaking (thank God she doesn't have Covid) but just in general caring for someone with this terrible disease is hard enough. sending positive thoughts"
806,2020-07-28,"I absolutely believe the pandemic and lockdown is what caused my grandfather to pass away. He didn't even have covid but he did have dementia and he was pretty active before everything closed, despite his inability to drive or take care of himself. "
807,2020-07-28,COVID has taken away being able to sit with my mom during her last month of her life in a hospital and a proper funeral service for my mom. She had dementia and stage 4 cancer. I imagine she was scared not knowing where she was and seeing unfamiliar faces covered in masks.
808,2020-07-28,I thought he had dementia? How does he remember all the times he was told this? My grandma certainly would not have remembered this type of thing in her final year. Seems a little like you wanna force a narrative that says covid hysteria is bad or at least worse than covid.
809,2020-07-28,This is so absolutely tragic. My dad died two years ago after a long battle with dementia. Each day I am thankful for small mercies he didn't have to live through Covid-19. May their souls rest in eternal peace.
810,2020-07-28,"Our 93 year old mother with vascular dementia is in a MA nursing home, where her whole unit tested positive for COVID a month ago. sister is her guardian; she has to visit from outside. I‚Äôm stuck in FL cant see Mom or give my sister a two week break"
811,2020-07-28,"Update: my stepdad was in the hospital for 4 days, pneumonia in one lung, plus COVID. He has dementia so it was VERY confusing for him to be away from my mom/home. Antibiotics  and  fluids  and  food helped him get his strength back up."
812,2020-07-28,"My 89 yo Father-in-law, with heart disease, Parkinson‚Äôs, diabetes, and dementia had COVID-19 and was treated with hydroxyqloroqine  and  zinc. He was cured."
813,2020-07-28,"My mom just passed yesterday, she was in assisted living with dementia related issues, COVID took away our ability to visit at a time when visits were so important, you can't expect them to know or understand what's happening, they just know they're alone!"
814,2020-07-28,"I'm 69 years old. I've survived a lot. I fought against Vietnam, managed two sons, had cancer twice and beat it. Lost family to covid. Various medical issues. Nursed my mom through dementia. Married for 35 years and counting. Still here. Still looking for justice."
815,2020-07-28,Nothing wrong with your logic. Not stupid or cynical. A lot of these people would have died in the next 12 months. My Auntie who had dementia and Cancer was given 12 months in January. She was also contracted Covid in April. She died in June.
816,2020-07-28,"My dad, in a completely Covid-free home, dementia, 93 years old, normally hospitalised x2 yearly with pneumonia. Hasn‚Äôt happened this year so far - free from Covid and everything else. Coming out of lockdown germs will be rife."
817,2020-07-28,"BS, they are bad, the way they treated my dad who had dementia was damn god awful, I would cry after visiting him ,many complaints and nothing occurred. And that was way before Covid , cant imagine what they are like now .PROFITS FIRST @GregHuntMP"
818,2020-07-28,Me too. I heard that my sister who's a retired RN was so mad about his handling of COVID she switched sides but now I hear she's changed back. I suspect dementia.
819,2020-07-28,My mother died last year back in Aug. Wednesday will mark her 80th birthday. It's difficult üòî now that she's gone. I'm thankful that she wasn't here for this Covid crap. Especially with her having dementia.

821,2020-07-28,"‚ÄòRemind me, which case is this one?‚Äô Volume of new CoVID consults every day such that I can never keep it straight without referring to my notes. My fellow thinks I may have early onset dementia üòêüò¨"
822,2020-07-28,My grandma died from covid... Yes she was in a nursing home and yes she had dementia and Parkinson's but covid definitely did her in.
823,2020-07-27,"I've lost some income but the hardest part is being stuck 24/7 in the house with my Mom who has severe dementia. It is hell! She had a daycare but it closed. I can't get respite bc I'm terrified of exposing her to covid. I fight loneliness, depression and boredom everyday!"
824,2020-07-27,"I agree my 96 yr mum in law survived surgery for a broken hip, made a recovery and although had dementia was doing well. She caught covid in a care home and died. Im convinced shed have enjoyed at least one more summer with us."

826,2020-07-27,I'm really not a fan when I have to do catch up and get it done .I used to do it weekly but covid hit in march and being a carer for dementia patients my work was full on ..so hopefully catch up when i can get some me time üòâ
827,2020-07-27,my great grandpa has been on a severe decline due to dementia over the last year and now he is dying from COVID. I am having the hardest time mourning/sympathizing with a man who was cruel to my grandmother and his family. very weird headspace to be in.
828,2020-07-27,"So my grandma has covid-19 and is in the hospital now... like please wear a fucking mask I can‚Äôt like my grandma might die she has dementia so she doesn‚Äôt even remember me that well, but still think of your families"
829,2020-07-27,"This is beautiful. My dear late stepdad had dementia, holding his hand was everything. I cannot imagine how hard this all is during covid. Wishing you and your dad the best."
830,2020-07-27,"Yes my father in law, he was only 94, had dementia and had smoked roll ups since he was 12, but Covid got the poor bastard üò≥"
831,2020-07-27,"I'm pretty glad almost all of my family is out of state and can't guilt or judge like this. On the other hand, I really wanted to visit my grandmother in North Carolina this summer before she slips into full-blown dementia and doesn't remember me, so...COVID still sucks."

833,2020-07-27,Stress and isolation can cause dementia to worsen. My aunt with dementia in a assisted living is not allowed visitors since the covid started and she has gotten much worse.
834,2020-07-27,"Mum just calle me to inflrm me that my grandpa, who as dementia and is in aged care has been exposed to Covid 19. Due to a agency worker testing positive.... I‚Äôm so freaking g worried right now ‚òπÔ∏è"
835,2020-07-27,"My grandmother is 91, in a nursing home, and has dementia. If she gets COVID, she will not survive. I feel for this woman, because I too, would be brokenhearted if the woman who helped raise me died alone. Our elderly matter, we owe them more than this. "
836,2020-07-27,"Posting for the ‚ÄòCOVID is fake‚Äô crowd. This is my father-in-law. Several weeks ago, he was admitted to the hospital for issues related to his dementia, but he was healthy otherwise. He now has COVID pneumonia  and  was placed on a ventilator last night. Requesting your prayers. "
837,2020-07-27,My dad has vascular dementia too but he died of covid in April so if my wearing a mask for 30 mins while I go shopping could possibly help stop the spread of the virus then to me it‚Äôs a very tiny sacrifice
838,2020-07-27,"Slimy squirrel should get infected with AIDS, TB, COVID, DEMENTIA, all at the same time. And then die by burning at the stake. "

844,2020-07-26,Do better research. If Cuomo hadn't deleted his Order from his website you would see. My daughter (has dementia from 2009 pandemic) and got Covid a couple weeks after his Order. You still didn't answer why he deleted it from his website.

848,2020-07-26,"Uh, I AM caring for elderly high risk family who are also suffering from dementia, Alzheimer‚Äôs and C-Diff and C-Diff is the last thing that needs to be combined with COVID. My tests are to CARE for people. Thank you."

966,2020-07-20,"Yes, so many and people posted death certs on here. My experience, very frail, very elderly bedridden lady being nursed in terminal care for cancer... COVID. Aunt of cousin, severe dementia, stopped eating. Cousin at bedside night before death... COVID. üôÑ"

969,2020-07-20,Also if my grandma has dementia. And corona virus and she dies. She better damn well be listed as a covid death. You know damn well covid contributed to her dying faster than without. And that‚Äôs make u a murderer.
970,2020-07-20,"""COVID-19 has 19 different names. It is what the 19 stands for. I can recite them all, it is how I got a perfect score on my dementia test. Everyone was surprised."""
971,2020-07-20,"I don't know if anyone will see this, but my dad's in a nursing home and I just found out he tested positive for COVID. I haven't been able to see him other than facetime since March, and now he's in isolation so I can't even do that. Thank God for dementia. üòï"
972,2020-07-20,"In Ontario (my province) it‚Äôs over 80% of deaths in nursing homes. Average (heavily skewed by the few that live for years) lifespan once in LTC is 2 years and over 70% have dementia. While tragic, one should also look at QALY with covid vs lockdown."
973,2020-07-20,"Actually, the COVID victims were seniors living in nursing homes in New York, one of them I believe with dementia, and mysteriously ""died"" one with not much diference from the other. Nothing to do with masks. Btw, masks do no good unless your wash your hands and follow a protocol"
974,2020-07-20,"The life expectancy in LTC is not even 30 months. You're there to die a slow death from Alzheimer's, basically. My neighbour refused treatment for pneumonia for her husband so he wouldn't have to go to the bitter end. Covid is actually a better death than dementia."
975,2020-07-20,That was a beautiful tribute. Hit home as I'm losing my mom to dementia and covid isolation. Good vibes to Patrick in this tough time. That was very well said.

977,2020-07-20,My father has dementia. I am trying to him into a home as he has deteriorated @DementiaUK . Trying to get a covid test for him@GOVUK @DHSCgovuk What a shambles üò°
978,2020-07-20,"My neighbour works in a dementia home. 14 residents had covid and recovered. All 14 have since deteriorated markedly with their dementia and are unlikely to last longer, when before they were stable. Covid has long lasting effects and can contribute to their deaths in many ways"
979,2020-07-20,"This is my mom. She has vascular dementia. She fractured her femur on Valentines Day. 4 of the 7 women she lived with died of Covid. She had Covid, is on hospice care and now resides in a nursing home. 2 weeks ago we were finally able to begin in person visits. Covid is real. "
980,2020-07-20,Please watch this interview. This is proof he makes up his own numbers and facts. He uses data form other countries when it comes to covid and he brags about passing a test tat proves he doesn‚Äôt have dementia. My favorite line tho ‚ÄúI look at school‚Äù can‚Äôt make that ship up
981,2020-07-20,My friends in law just passed of dementia in Hou-Tx and they told the family she tested pos for Covid but refused to share the testing; The family asked why she wasn't treated and of course no-one could visit even with masks which evry1 knows work 100% right? Death ruled Covid
982,2020-07-20,"I finally got to visit my mom today, after months #Covid ( which is now ember here) ..she didn‚Äôt know who I was! I‚Äôve survived some shit but this was the hardest day of my life. #dimentia"

984,2020-07-20,"He did however explicitly point out that he is wrong on the daily death toll of Covid, and that the stupid dementia test is an embarrassing thing to brag about... Two things I didn‚Äôt expect from a Fox interviewer. But yeah, I‚Äôll dial my praise back a bit, it‚Äôs all relative..."
985,2020-07-20,Tin foil hat theory : maybe the special swabs are tainted w/Covid to purposefully infect portions of population and his dementia mind can't keep a secret - by testing some we ARE creating cases. Lol I know - I've heard some crazy ones lately but I thought of that by myself ha!
986,2020-07-20,"Last thing I‚Äôm going to say: my elderly mother has the beginnings of dementia and with Covid and financial burdens, I‚Äôm struggling as an only child when my grandmother has had 9 to support her. So...no one is immune"

988,2020-07-19,Both my parents had dementia and died at 79 and 80. I am also 60! I thought I had 12 years of sanity lef5 but BREXIT and COVID have changed that! 
989,2020-07-19,"It's...hard. My grandma developed dementia prior to Covid,  and  no one could take care of her so my aunt placed her in a nursing facility. Then facility became Covid-positive; my aunt fought to see her. Then gma had a stroke that made her unable to swallow. She passed last night."
990,2020-07-19,My 85 yr old Fox addicted dementia dad looks at one thing: the stock market. Nothing else matters. Because I guess he thinks he‚Äôs taking his money with him when he gets Covid and dies.

992,2020-07-19,When are you going to let me see my elderly mum Boris who for over 4 months now is lockdown in a Covid free Nursing Home suffering with dementia. I am allowed 1 window visit pw for 15 minutes before a snatch and grab takes place. She is 92. More silence?
993,2020-07-19,"That's different from dying *of* covid, but rather dying *with* covid, like my grandfather did. It certainly accelerated his death, but I'd say the cancer and dementia helped. He's still one of the 1547 though."
994,2020-07-19,"Today we got the call that my grandpa tested positive for COVID-19. He has dementia and stage 4 cancer. The next couple weeks are going to be rough üò¢ Also - after he fell really hard earlier this week, they let my dad in to visit him. Now he needs to get tested too... üòî "
995,2020-07-19,"I‚Äôm so sorry 4 all you are going through. This yr is so bad. My dads in bad shape dementia diagnosed this yr, 1st time 15 1/2 yrs of seizures as of 2day my spec needs son had seizure but he just seized only 5 days ago its bad. Docs R sure my son had covid bad b4 they announced it"
996,2020-07-19,Why can‚Äôt the homes limit visitation to just the POA‚Äôs? Test them and let them in. My 93 y/o mom survived COVID but now being isolated might not survive ‚ÄúFlat Affect‚Äú. Isolation is terrible for the residents who have dementia.
997,2020-07-19,"There was one day where my great-grandpa (79, diabetic, dementia) lost his breath 25 times. That was 25 times we could have potentially lost him. But with the grace of God and the support of our family and his strength he has fully recovered from Covid"
998,2020-07-19,Sorry to your family for that happening. My grandma had dementia but passed a few years ago. Was in LTC. I couldn't imagine her being in a covid LTC this year.
999,2020-07-19,"Let me tell you this before I go. My cousin got dementia at a young age. She was dying, in April she hadn't eaten in over a week  and  was about to pass away. 48hrs before dying she tested negative. Her death certificate says covid because she died in a home that had covid in it."
1000,2020-07-19,"It‚Äôs when a lot of difficult things happen at once that makes things harder,eh? I‚Äôm ok. Sad about my mum - her dementia is much worse since she had Covid."
1001,2020-07-19,"Hugely embarrassing,more like a national scandal!! I bet the true figures are well below 5000 . How can my mother in law die of covid when no cases in the home and doc confirmed dementia!"
1002,2020-07-19,My sister in law is a PSW for patients with dementia and when Covid hit because of my brothers immune system had to go on leave and he has alway been one to help others and fix things but as you know with this shitty disease you can‚Äôt do what you use to and he had been alone
1003,2020-07-19,My ex husband is in a group home in Phx. He has Parkinson‚Äôs w/dementia and he actually survived covid too. My son stands outside his window in a sliver of shade hiding from Phx sun to visit his Dad. It‚Äôs heartbreaking. 
1004,2020-07-18,My new neighbor told me this a.m. that she had to put her mom (87 w/ dementia) in assisted living in Mesa a month ago. Her mother now has COVID along w/ 11 other residents and unk #of staff. She's heartbroken.
1005,2020-07-18,Spent the day with my mum. I have not seen her since February due to Covid. She has dementia but she still remembers me. Thank god! We had a brilliant day sitting in the garden. Hated leaving her but hope to get back down in the next month. 
1006,2020-07-18,"My mom is in the nursing home with dementia, we have no it been able to see her since all this covid crap started. Bad thing is we can‚Äôt talk to her on the phone because she can‚Äôt hear us. It‚Äôs a sad time."
1007,2020-07-18,"Dave, a week ago my Dad at 94 died peacefully in his sleep from old age. He had no illness other than mild dementia and yet, despite not even being examined, let alone tested, his death certificate showed ‚ÄúCovid 19 related‚Äù. Explain that."
1008,2020-07-18,"Have to say my MIL passed away due to mixed dementia a few weeks ago, and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs on her death certificate. They couldn‚Äôt get away with putting covid on since she was in one of the care homes that have not had any cases at all due to locking down early and good practice"
1009,2020-07-18,This is my Mamo she has dementia. We haven't seen her in months because of COVID.I was terrified that she may forget us. We had our first window visit yesterday and this was her reaction to seeing us. Please wear your mask and stay home if you are sick so I can hug my Mamo again 
1010,2020-07-18,Sorry on the loss of your Grandpa. My brother has Dementia - both diseases are Robbers. And to say that he died of COVID is outrageous. :( Bless you and your family. May your Grandpa rest in piece. Heaven has another Angel.
1011,2020-07-18,"My point is the combination of an isolating disease like Covid combined with dementia, it‚Äôs hard enough for some people with dementia to recognize family but when you cannot see their face or touch their skin. When dementia isolates your memory, then add physical isolation to it"
1012,2020-07-18,"Learning about the deaths of two classmates and seeing a 4 minute heartwrenching video put together about my aunt, who is suffering from dementia (and who caught COVID but did super well with it), is giving me the feels. Sigh."
1013,2020-07-18,Crying cause I miss my grandma. Her dementia keeps progressing and I can‚Äôt see her because of COVID

1016,2020-07-18,I lost my mom on 3/14/20 to pnuemonia(covid?) and dementia. Nothing was more difficult than watching the vibrant sophisticated outgoing woman that raised me live her final days gripped by this horrible affliction! 
1017,2020-07-18,My mum debbie! A care worker for residents with dementia etc risking her life during covid and caught it herself and she was absolutely terrified I‚Äôd get it (I didn‚Äôt) but she isolated herself in her room for literally a whole week!
1018,2020-07-18,"My heart feels your heart! My grandmother had a stroke died from complications soon after, had dementia and her death cert only listed Covid for cause of death, no autopsy.She died alone, scared and ALONE. My rage has no end for the atrocities put on my family."
1019,2020-07-17,"My heart goes out to both of you. I watched another deceased person leave on a covered gourney today. Fought COVID, but it destroyed her body. It finally took her 2 months after her initial infection. Dementia? yes. But perfect health before COVID."

1024,2020-07-17,"50,335 deaths involving Covid19 between March-June this year. Dementia leading cause of death in June, then Heart, then Covid. Personally I‚Äôm pleased to see these figures falling. Now, where‚Äôs my mask?!"
1025,2020-07-17,All these figures are suspect until investigated with hindsight. There may prove to be no ‚Äúexcess deaths‚Äù (as none of us can die more than once). Dementia appeared on my mums death certificate and I guess thousands of deaths are in effect ‚Äúdementia with Covid‚Äù
1026,2020-07-17,"My uncle, who some of you know was admitted to a care home last year for late stage dementia, has been admitted to ICU yesterday with COVID. The prognosis for recovery is not good. If you pray, please say a prayer for him."

She was never tested for Covid-19 either."
1030,2020-07-17,"Hi Glen. My mom has had dementia for almost 10 years, gradually getting worse. She is 90 and in an assisted living facility. I haven‚Äôt been able to visit her since March because of COVID. She tested positive for COVID in late May. She‚Äôs doing good except for lack of appetite"
1031,2020-07-17,Called and talked to my mother that has dementia. I am pretty much the only one she still knows. Then called my little sister who just got out of hospital after major surgery. With the Covid I cannot leave my home due to my mentally handicapped foster guys.
1032,2020-07-17,i miss being with my grand & great grandparents in person. fuck covid. thankful for zoom but my great grandmama has alzheimer‚Äôs  and  dementia so it‚Äôs not the same as getting to hold her hand

1038,2020-07-17,"Too bloody right. Far too many risks, not enough precaution. When my grandad died of covid in the dementia home it suddenly appeared in, in March, I said bojo and hancock should be hanged. I've calmed down a fair bit since then, but my mind is still made up. "
1039,2020-07-17,"That's not my point, which is that if covid truncates a life by many years you're suggesting all those years of life are irrelevant. Yes, dementia is significant in co-morbidity, but all premature death constitutes a tragedy; those lives matter."
1040,2020-07-17,"Same as my mother in law. Been ill for years. Died due to dementia, pneumonia and covid. Passed 2 tests in 2 weeks failed the 3rd test. So was listed as covid. It makes no sense"
1041,2020-07-17,"No it doesn‚Äôt, but I will tell you something. I believed this about covid until my mother in law died of dementia, was confirmed by doctor, no cases in the home at all but when got death certificate covid was put as the cause. Now you tell me why that is?"
1042,2020-07-17,Poor son. That is a double whammy. Having a father with signs of dementia and COVID.

1052,2020-07-17,I would believe it. My father was in a nursing home here. He had dementia. He passed about 4 months ago. When my sister (who had poa) received his deth cert. It stated he passed from covid yet he passed from heart failure due to dementia. We fought it and the coroner changed it.
1053,2020-07-17,Technically that‚Äôs impossible because lockdown happened a day after my birthday which is the 22nd of March and I don‚Äôt have covid induced dementia as far as I know so get your facts right

1076,2020-07-15,"When my father was diagnosed in Dec this used to happen at 4pm every afternoon, it was awful to experience. He passed away on May 20th from Covid in a care home. We loved him so much but hated what Dementia had done to him. Heartbreaking üíîüíîüíîüíîüíî"
1077,2020-07-15,My great uncle/padrino was 83 years old w/advanced dementia. He never left his house during pandemic. But he had a home care worker visit him frequently. Those folks weren't tested during early stages of pandemic. He died of COVID two months ago. Nobody else had COVID in house. 
1078,2020-07-15,"My mother with dementia has been in the hospital since December. She literally has not been outside since and in a small 4 bed room. No space, no TV, no stimulation. Did we not let over 2000 prisoners out due to COVID? My mother is in her own prison. We need a LTC bed now."

1080,2020-07-15,"Word. My dad, suffering from dementia, is moving from a nursing home in NS to one in Port Hope next week. And if Clara doesn't go to school it'll cripple me, re: work. While contracting Covid in Ptbo remains statistically remote, I'm still 100% in favour of precautions."
1081,2020-07-15,This is actually true of more than just Covid. Boomers in my experience seem astonishingly bad at preparing for anything related to ageing except retirement. They don't ever seem to consider they might need to go into a home or deal with dementia and make no plans for it.

1086,2020-07-15,Have you spoken to the care homes? They have identified that Dementia deaths have increased due to #COVID19 when hospitals moved patients without Covid tests under Gov instruction. My father tested negative before he returned home after a hospital stay.
1087,2020-07-15,My nana is developing dementia so her short term memory isn't there but her long term memory is. She remembers that I'm a scientist so every week she calls me and asks me why she's at such a high risk of dying from COVID-19.

1095,2020-07-14,I will no longer called it Rona or COVID. I call this beautiful madness chaos. The song is almost over for musical chairs. Another alleged 400 yrs boy by I'm gone stand in honor before I die... for my ancestors. For my 103 year old grandmother with dementia. A man made disease.
1096,2020-07-14,I don‚Äôt have the right words but just very sorry for you and your family. My mother died in the middle of the virus thing not of Covid but dementia. She was in Lockdown hence no family visits. I too am the brave face one. So sorry for you

1102,2020-07-14,"My papa was in a nursing home and they went on complete lockdown when it got bad in Oklahoma. He had dementia real bad and thought my nana had left him. Not even two-three weeks later, he passed away. There wasn‚Äôt COVID in the nursing home, but pretty sure they still"
1103,2020-07-14,"Yes, that's how it was for two months in my dad's assisted living facility. To their credit, they had no COVID cases. For residents in better shape (activities, phone, computer), it was bearable, but my dad was sliding into dementia (can't use a phone), so his confusion deepened."

1106,2020-07-14,"Thanks, apparently @smokinj45508225 isn't on but I'm sure he'd say hi! I'm road tripping today with the kids to check on my mom...she is in owen sound, she's got early dementia  and  I've only been able to see her twice during this whole covid crap, she's 74  and  lives alone."
1107,2020-07-14,"My mom, who had dementia, passed away right before the Covid crisis began to get out of hand. Mom would have not understood if I had been forced to desert her. I can't imagine the heartache of those who were victims of this virus  and  Cuomo's irresponsible  and  reprehensible actions. "
1108,2020-07-14,I have no problem with wearing one if required & neither does my family. However my dad is 79 and has dementia. He does not comprehend what has happened the last 4 months with COVID-19 and will not wear a face mask. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

1114,2020-07-14,"It's my mum's birthday today. She works at a dementia care home and since the outbreak has seen 13 of her residents die of it. The staff went weeks without PPE (thanks to the shit gov) Take covid seriously, it's not over just because the selfish gov want you spending money again."
1115,2020-07-14,"I moved my father in law out of nursing home and into my house due to covid. He has dementia/alzheimers. Anyhow, it really helps me understand and appreciate Williams' thought process behind his final decision."

1121,2020-07-14,I‚Äôm just in college but I‚Äôm terrified to go back to school. My school seems to not really care about the students wellbeing. After telling them about living with my 94 year old grandma with dementia they still didn‚Äôt care. I will not let my family members get COVID from me.
1122,2020-07-14,The whole hallucinations thing is really terrifying to me. I think because I witnessed my father begin to hallucinate the last couple of years of his life from dementia. ü¶† One Texan‚Äôs battle to survive COVID-19 
1123,2020-07-14,My aunt died of Covid after 5 LONG years of dimentia. Care to guess what‚Äôs on her death certificate? From the hospital? In a state with a mask mandate and extended lockdown? Either they killed her or they lied. You are clueless.

1134,2020-07-13,"Obviously a scam and my uncle lost a lot of $before he died. He clearly suffered from some dementia. But not full blown. Anyway, @chuckwoolery has an illness like this. He‚Äôs convinced that everyone around the world is lying about covid. It‚Äôs a little sad to see. 3/3"
1135,2020-07-13,"Are these deaths stating Covid on the certificate? 'Suspected Covid' was replaced with community acquired pneumonia, heart failure or dementia, meaning deaths like my dad, were excluded wrongly from the Covid figures."

1145,2020-07-12,You have my sympathy; I lost my 86 year old mom in early March from a long bout of dementia rather than Covid. We still have not been able to have a memorial service or bury her cremains in our family cemetery plot 3 hours away. It's awful not to have closure.
1146,2020-07-12,"Not sure whether she had COVID, I don't think she was tested for it, but this is how my grandmother died in LTC in early April. She had dementia, refused to eat for a few weeks, we weren't allowed in to help her, and she died alone."
1147,2020-07-12,It‚Äôs not all COVID deaths but I‚Äôm sure a good percentage are. My FIL is in this stand-alone section and he died of dementia. I believe the COVID link here is that the Chronicle is trying to help families grieve during this COVID pandemic when a normal funeral is not ok.

1287,2020-07-06,"This is my grandma. She is currently in a dementia care facility. I haven‚Äôt been able to hug her, hold her, cry on her, etc. in over 4 months due to COVID-19. This morning I found out she, along with a cluster of other patients, have been diagnosed with COVID. I‚Äôm scared. "

1292,2020-07-06,My friend's mom died from long term heart and dementia conditions and they put COVID on her death cert. That's why I don't trust the numbers. They are going back and listing people who died months ago as COVID when they had and have no idea if that was the cause #COVID19 #MAGA

1296,2020-07-06,Had my dementia patient husband in the drs last week. Oxygen level was at 83 and supposed to be 95. I was told it was low due to mask. Nice that someone with a deteriorating brain already can‚Äôt get much need oxygen. I‚Äôd rather take my chance with COVID
1297,2020-07-06,"My Mom has Covid, she survived polio as a baby, had breast cancer and a heart valve replacement as an adult, and now has dementia and post polio syndrome which means she is in a care home. It is all unfair, and awful."

1312,2020-07-05,"We know those figures don't represent people dying OF Covid. My half sister's nan was nearly 94 with dementia, health problems and her death was put down as Covid, which is a nonsense. They are similar figures to every flu season and it's exactly the same people who are affected."
1313,2020-07-05,I got laid off my job @the dementia center indefinitely because they are removing the recreations dept. entirely due to covid. I‚Äôm so worried about my future. I wish for my next job to be everything I need it to be  and  I hope it comes SOON. üßøüßøüßø

1315,2020-07-05,"My daughter in laws Nan died of covid, my niece had a form of covid. At the time it was all plausible with all the media hype and fear. The Nan was 92 suffering with dementia, my niece had flu. Once u get passed the lies they can say covid for any death. It was all bullshit"
1316,2020-07-05,My Nanna fought dementia for years and had such a healthy body. It breaks my heart she has covid on her death certificate. I‚Äôm just angry.

1331,2020-07-04,My grandma developed dementia and because of covid it‚Äôs become worse. After many medications today was the first time in such a long time she seemed herself. All I‚Äôm asking is for prayer so she can find a balance and just live the happy life she taught my family and I to live. 
1332,2020-07-04,My place is a 2 bedroom unit that desperately needs t.l.c in central west tasmania past cradle mountain in the valley of the mountains. Thanks to covid and dad's dementia I have credits on power and water . The rain forest is out it of this world and I get a warm breeze cold day.
1333,2020-07-03,Yes my father in law died of dementia only 2 weeks ago after going through the merry go round of NHS care that sent him back to a care home in which he tested positive and only after 7 days in there did the move him back out onto a covid ward where he tested negative. Clap away.

1336,2020-07-03,"Plus I pick him up monday to take for Covid test  and  labs. He's been in lockdown  and  i've talked on phone (hard w/ dementia) and done one gate visit (he called it a cage, so don't want to do those). So I'll grab a car lunch for him  and  take him to say hi to my daughter after."
1337,2020-07-03,"My mom got covid and she has dementia. I asked the infection and disease dr. to give her Hydroxychloroquine  and  he said .. ‚Äúthey won‚Äôt allow me at this hospital‚Äù i said does it not work? He said ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs not that, it‚Äôs just this hospital doesn‚Äôt prescribe it here, but I‚Äôll ask‚Äù "
1338,2020-07-03,"Make that 29,000 excess deaths. So what other explanation do you have? ""Well my nan had dementia and then died and they put it down to Covid and it wasn't"" So these 29,000 died of what?"
1339,2020-07-03,"The toll on my life has been huge in every way you mention.

Began a new anti-anxiety med yesterday! "
1340,2020-07-03,That is so nice of you. I wish I could still fit into my high school t-shirt. My father has dementia. It‚Äôs a horrible disease. I have not been able to visit him for months but we video chat. So many lives lost in our care facilities here due to Covid-19 and deplorable conditions.

1343,2020-07-03,"My mum died this week, not Covid related (possibly protected as we‚Äôd been able to care for her at home through her dementia). I am angry that pubs are reopening when this pandemic has not gone away, whilst I haven‚Äôt hugged my 88year old Dad because I want to keep him safe."
1344,2020-07-03,I watched them a few doors down. I wanted to speak to them but because of Covid I didn't. They were trying to talk to my neighbor who has dementia. I thought they would figure it out but they didn't. They should have waited for her husband to get home.
1345,2020-07-03,No one I know got COvID particularly my 98 year old Mom with dementia who recognized us yet again thru the fog of dementia  and  a window. Oops. That was 2 good things. Gratitude.
1346,2020-07-03,"Let me tell you what this covid lockdown did, it killed my daddy. He had dementia and he was still doing good, then the lockdown, we weren't there to hold him and to help feed him. When we went to see him, he was a shell, there was nothing left of him. I am so angry."
1347,2020-07-03,Idiots overregulating ppl are killing my Aunt. She has dementia  and  was in assisted living  and  doesn‚Äôt understand why she can‚Äôt see anyone  and  is suffering from depression. She doesn‚Äôt have COVID but was transferred to hospice because she‚Äôs refusing to eat  and  is starving to death.

1353,2020-07-02,Thank you. Elderly man who assaulted my mum was admitted to the CH two weeks before my mum. They were both sent to a residential home not capable of caring for dementia patients with challenging needs. Neither would have been sent there if it were not for the Covid discharge.
1354,2020-07-02,My veterinarian just told me both her parents just caught covid in a nursing home one has dementia and the other one was in ICU for two weeks. What you‚Äôve done to the elderly in nursing homes for four months should be a life sentence in prison . You know what you‚Äôre done

1391,2020-07-01,"Tonight, on what would‚Äôve been my dad‚Äôs 2-year anniversary of retirement, he moved into a nursing home after a rapid decline of dementia, a stroke,  and more. Bittersweet, though mostly bitter with COVID-19. Here‚Äôs something I wrote two years ago to celebrate: "
1392,2020-07-01,"So, my mom is in long term care, she has progressing dementia and covid has pretty much confused the fuck out of her. She was pretty clear last Thursday when she called and told me about an instance of abuse she suffered though."
1393,2020-06-30,"The covid delirium or dementia or whatever it is, is an absolute nightmare. Once he was convinced I was my sister in law and was messing with him on FaceTime. She‚Äôs Asian. He keeps asking when he can leave or telling us he‚Äôll tell us something when he gets home (we sold his home)"
1394,2020-06-30,"Y‚Äôall.. my family & I weren‚Äôt able to see my Aunt, who is in the nursing home , due to COVID-19. ALSO my Aunt has dementia! We were so worried she wouldn‚Äôt really remember us even though we‚Äôve been calling her on the phone. Last week we were able to schedule an appointment for..."
1395,2020-06-30,I keep thinking about my dear friend who visited his wife of 61 yrs every day at her assisted living facility (dementia) for the past 7yrs. Then covid happened and they locked the place down in March so he couldn't visit anymore...she rapidly declined and died in Mayüíîüíîüò¢
1396,2020-06-30,"she has dementia and doesn't speak english, literally she is unable to even form sentences anymore. if we leave her in a hospital she will think we abandoned her. i don't have my license yet nor a car because of covid-19 and i don't even have a job, so hypothetically if my mom"
1397,2020-06-30,"the only ""positive"" to my grandma's advanced dementia during covid? she has no idea the world is falling apart and thinks we are all home to spend time with her (she likes to lay on my bed while I work)."
1398,2020-06-30,"Jan 31st I lost my dad to dementia. He was cremated and the intention was my brother and I would get together and release his ashes in the FL Gulf. Due to Covid-19, dad is still in my closet. I know people are asking is she laughing or crying. The answer is both. #tryingtimes"
1399,2020-06-30,"I think my grandmother had something similar as she deteriorated. I was wondering actually, do you think Covid has accelerated your Mum's dementia? We saw a very marked effect on Mum. Unsure if any illness/infection would have the same effect."
1400,2020-06-30,Interesting and hard choice. We all make different choices. My mum has dementia and if she gets covid (practically no risk of getting it) my brother and I would ask to sign a dnr before the drs even considered it. My daughter knows I don‚Äôt want to get as bad as my mum.
1401,2020-06-30,Personal rant. I hate pretty much everyone right now. I hate the slow progression of my mother's dementia. I hate being told what I need. I hate all who won't take precautions re: covid. I hate the Gov. that is letting an adversary dictate or country. People really suck.
1402,2020-06-30,You do realise having an underlying health condition doesn't necessarily mean you are on your death bed. My Dad died from it and he may has had vascular dementia since 2018 but he was not on his death bed. If not for covid he would be here. Quite insensitive of you
1403,2020-06-30,Thank you @jienya yes. I saw and know this. Covid causes thickening of the blood and clots as well as dementia increase. My father was kinda fine one week and off the Hong driving in the middle of the state when we were called to come get him. My sister went and he mentaller zip!
1404,2020-06-30,"This week, my bivocational ministry ministry entails seeking a hospital bed for a dementia sufferer who's been in the ER for 2 weeks. I've learned *psych units discriminate against large strong men *COVID makes mental health placement much harder *the vulnerable languish in ERs"
1405,2020-06-30,"My mom is 87, has a pacemaker and dimentia. She had Covid in April. Mild fever and lethargy for a week. Covid is not a death sentence. Most listed as dying from Covid would have died from other causes. This is all about control."
1406,2020-06-30,My mums DNR said do not return to hospital with Covid. When she returned with head injuries I discovered her hospital records stated do not admit to ICU. She was effectively denied all intensive treatment because she had dementia! My mum wanted to live she did not want to die.
1407,2020-06-30,"Sadly, it is completely political. My mom is in a nursing home with severe dementia. She passed out and had to go to the hospital. Immediately she was labeled COVID +. cause that hospital labels ALL patients that come from a nursing home COVID +. Why? They get more money."
1408,2020-06-30,My aunt had COVID on her death certificate. She was 97 and was in a home with dementia. She also had heart problems and high blood pressure.

1410,2020-06-30,"Brave can be hard because I'm shy & an introvert. But I do speak up, for my mom, who's got dementia lives in a nursing home. I used to visit her often but bc covid it's 2 days/week/i hr day. She's got a cough and she's weezing so I'm going to talk to her Doctor about this. üíñ"
1411,2020-06-30,My 33-year-old daughter got dementia from the 2009 pandemic. is now in a nursing home and is recovered from Covid. Many people have been protesting the fact that we haven't seen our loved ones in almost 4 months. Cuomo's politicizing this - the numbers are very low.
1412,2020-06-29,had to help my dad as his vascular dementia worsened significantly during lockdown and he has now died of Covid-19 after 9 weeks of shielding. There is no right and no wrong. You have to do what is best for you both. But think through the consequences very carefully. Best of luck
1413,2020-06-29,"Dementia is not insanity and mass murdering. You are not even a man, since you hide yourself behind a pic. Pathetic individual. I'm not religious, but tonight I will pray to my Gods to send Mr. Covid-19 to you."
1414,2020-06-29,covid killed my father and five others at the dementia facility he was at and then three weeks after that my entire family came down with it
1415,2020-06-29,"PSA: 1. My husband is a hospitalist. He currently has 2 elderly patients,1 in her 90‚Äôs & 1 in his 80‚Äôs, neither of whom have an advance directive. They both have late stage dementia  and  both covid +. Because there is no living will, they are not DNR‚Äôs."
1416,2020-06-29,"So delighted with my Lewis Chessman whistle, whittled by ‚Å¶@george_rook‚Å© . And love the blossoming of crafts we are seeing during these #covid times... "
1417,2020-06-29,"Feel ya. Now I not only forget stuff, I can‚Äôt even remember even thinking it. My mom had dimentia. Broke my heart to se how vulnerable she was. But her loving grateful side took over. She passed in feb just before covid hit. Bittersweet blessing."
1418,2020-06-29,"Petertpan @petertpan ¬∑ My ex Father in Law died three weeks ago. He had exteme dementia, fell over and broke his hip. He died in hospital. No Post Mortem. Cause? Covid! Definitely an agenda at work here."
1419,2020-06-29,The impact of Covid on my Mum's dementia and diabetic treatment (or the lack of) has been detrimental to her overall wellbeing. Don't blame the NHS one bit but we should not have a system that has to choose even in a crisis. 
1420,2020-06-29,My dog trainer who I've been friends with for over 20 years mother died after testing positive for COVID-19. She was in her 80s and in a care home due to dementia.

1424,2020-06-29,"Boomers as a generation might suck but my dad, one of the kindest, most gentle humans I knew, who had dementia and Parkinson's passed away in the midst of covid lockdown (not from covid)... We haven't had a chance to mourn properly and honestly this is gross and uncaring"
1425,2020-06-29,"My auntie Gay, w/ dementia, has Covid. Only one I‚Äôve known. Please pray for her. After 10 days in hospital they transferred her to a state run convelescent home where she must quarantine longer! I‚Äôm scared for her. In CA."
1426,2020-06-29,"I‚Äôm going through something similar with my mom. The dementia isn‚Äôt to that level, but it‚Äôs getting worse. It‚Äôs hart because I live across the country and can‚Äôt be there... and now with the COVID... not sure when I can even see her again. "
1427,2020-06-28,Damn. These are hard times. My dad won‚Äôt let me visit bc virus (can‚Äôt fault him for being cautious tho!). A good friend has become a raging alcoholic. My wonderful neighbor is struggling with carrying for her husband with dementia. And my SIL just lost both parents to Covid. :(

1429,2020-06-28,Best: talked to my Mom on the phone and she was having a good memory day. She had dementia. Worst: Finding out that someone I work with has COVID-19

1432,2020-06-28,"This COVID is no joke, my grandma is slowly recovering but it really messed with her dementia. My grandpa is still in the hospital. This is not a hoax, people need to be careful. I hope Bill is doing better. #TeamKitKat"
1433,2020-06-28,"Realized that it will be a year before I see my mother again. Depending on Covid. She no longer responds to phone calls or video screens. Feel like she lost in a fog. Mourning a person who is basically gone bt physically still here, a person I can't visit.#Dementia"

1439,2020-06-28,Due to the full lockdown on nursing homes due to Covid 19 I haven't been able to see my Dad since March. This has been so hard especially with him being in the later stages of Dementia and doesn't understand what's going on. I had my first visit today.üòä My heart is so happy ‚ù§Ô∏è 
1440,2020-06-28,"My dad has dementia and was transported from his nursing home to the hospital Thursday night. With COVID protocols, no visitors are allowed in the hospital. I understand. But my dad is bound to be scared every time he wakes up, not knowing where he is or why he‚Äôs there."

1445,2020-06-28,So my grandmother has a form of dementia and is in an assisted living facility for memory care. Last week she was diagnosed with pneumonia. She has not been allowed visitors since March 10th due to COVID-19. She is rapidly declining and has given up. I just want to hold her. üò≠
1446,2020-06-28,My Grandmother passed away today due to complications from COVID-19. She was already in a Nursing Home for Dementia and the family has been unable to see her for a long while. She passed alone. I have no grandparents left now. Just remember to take care.
1447,2020-06-28,"My ""extra"" grandmother died from contracting covid-19 at a nursing home. She couldn't be taken home because of her dementia and it would have made everything worse for her. Almost 4 months ago but, I still cry every day about the fact that the woman was expendable to the pandemic"
1448,2020-06-27,My Sister passed in March and instead of saying Heart related to Lewy body dementia... it says CoVid. Which is wrong!! 
1449,2020-06-27,"I can empathize. I was so fearful of bringing any type of contagion home to my mom as her solecaregiver, w/her FTL dementia. I rarely went out--only when absolutely mandatory. I already worried about bring any sickness home w/me. Fear wise, re Covid, I'd have been overwrought."
1450,2020-06-27,No... he's not but..... he does sound incoherent at times but that's the dementia setting. He really sound worse than my Father who died at 80. Now... how FRIGHTENDED of COVID? Does it keep you up at night cringing in fear?
1451,2020-06-27,"One of my aunts passed away today. I didn't know her very well, but she was older and already battled COVID and other illnesses along with suffering from dementia. No one could visit her in the nursing home because of the pandemic. Wear your fucking mask."
1452,2020-06-27,"Let me reiterate.... people die all the time. Heart disease, suicide, car accidents you name it. 3 of my 4 grandmas died of other things. 4th is dying of dementia. However those never get reported. Only Covid (IMO the numbers are juiced)"
1453,2020-06-27,"A lot depends on you. Is there a DNR in place with facility? Every facility has different rules depending on what state you‚Äôre in. My Dad is in one , he has dementia. If DNR they do not take up an ICU bed/ventalator, they are taken to a step down care unit for covid"

That happens he just has to stand up there, grin,  and  hold up idiot talking point que cards. But on serious note, the man has obvious dementia...Cruel to exploit him like this!"
1459,2020-06-27,"I think you saved my day !! He‚Äôs dangerous when it comes to Covid vs opening to stop loosing millions of jobs and thousands of businesses while dealing with China, N Korea, Iran. The man clearly is showing signs of dementia at 78 he can‚Äôt retain a thought. "

1463,2020-06-27,"Don‚Äôt worry, many were falsely included in the death tolls. My Mum is a geriatric nurse (nurse the geriatric, she‚Äôs only 67) and had a doctor try to record a deaths from terminal cancer and dementia as COVID. Are you sure you know where the corruption is?"
1464,2020-06-27,"The aims of the so called ""Covid 19"" is eliminate the society burden - the elderly - get rid of them, not to protect them, as they assert hypocritically ! So they did to my mother who has dementia and very sick heart - locked her away from me and caused to die !! To Hell them!!!"

1493,2020-06-26,"And here we go. Who didn‚Äôt know this was coming? I guess if my candidate thought 120 million people in the U.S. had died from COVID-19, I probably wouldn‚Äôt want debates either. The man has dementia."
1494,2020-06-26,(PH) Every Friday morning without fail neighbours leave flowers at my gate. We make them into posies and deliver them w a lunch from @HelpRyedale to ppl who are shielding. Many are now friends. One plays ukulele for me at her door. For me this will be an abiding memory of #COVID 
1495,2020-06-26,"Yes. My mates grandpa. He 80 in a nursing home and had severe dementia. All about perspective. I‚Äôve asked this question a million times here in the UK. "" take out the nursing homes, do you know anybody that‚Äôs died from Covid?‚Äù The answer is ALWAYS no. My mum caught it In same...."
1496,2020-06-26,"I have to pretend I‚Äôm okay- if my mom does have Lewy Body Dementia, I cannot tell her my arm is getting worse; When she wasn‚Äôt on meds she pulled my arm so hard I laid in bed for 2 days straigh  and  the drs could take her away from us. Nursing homes are COVID-19 death zones."
1497,2020-06-26,It‚Äôs so hard to have my dad in hospital and not be able to visit. His dementia means he doesn‚Äôt understand why we‚Äôre not coming to be with him. I really hate Covid with a passion right now. #novisitingallowed
1498,2020-06-26,I can‚Äôt even imagine. I was talking to my brother tonight about how glad I am that mom died last October. She had dementia and not being able to see us if she got Covid...
1499,2020-06-26,"Thank you so much, disbelieving and careless residents of #Melbourne. This new spike in COVID-19 infections means I can't visit my parents' residential care home. My father is 93 and my mother, with dementia, is 90, and family contact is really important. Thanks a bunch."
1500,2020-06-26,"COVID-19 would be the last of the worry ! What about syphilis, gonorrhea, Chlamydia and dementia?"
1501,2020-06-26,My friends grandma‚Äôs death certificate said COVID and guess what??? She never had COVID. She passed when her dementia progressed because she couldn‚Äôt see her family. Way to add insult to injury. Sick
1502,2020-06-26,"My friends 92 year old mom had her leg amputated, her rehab facility she has to spend six weeks in has Covid patients on the first floor, she‚Äôs on the 3rd. @gretchenwhitmer with Gods grace, she will make it out of there. She has dementia by the way. Your stupid policies suck."
1503,2020-06-25,Mother-in-law had surgery. Due to COVID my Father-IL couldn‚Äôt be at the hospital. The staff didn‚Äôt know about MIL‚Äôs dementia. Between that and the pain meds she doesn't remember what happened or what her care instructions were. Interesting lesson for myself In future practice.
1504,2020-06-25,My mom was moved to a ‚ÄúCovid floor‚Äù mixed with dementia patients. She was in a 4 person room with no air conditioning to ‚Äúkill the virus‚Äù and all her stuff was thrown in a room; they didn‚Äôt even set up her TV she just stared at a wall in 86 degree heat ALONE.
1505,2020-06-25,0 Covid cases at my faculty through out this pandemic !! Lord has it been difficult to keep dementia patients on quarantine but we did that üòùü•≥ü§ôüèΩ 
1506,2020-06-25,"Thank CREATOR so much for my restored relationship with my father. Even hardship can be a blessing. Dementia and the isolation caused by covid, have worked in this aspect to be a blessing. Did CREATOR ""orchestrate"" this? I hate language like that, the framing is foolish."
1507,2020-06-25,Imo I'm not a expert but I stand by my belief its like dementia if you have dementia and pneumonia kills you it's a dementia death I think covid is like that
1508,2020-06-25,"Just been told from Monday I can book a 30 minute slot to visit my sister, she has dementia and has moved into a nursing home that we've not seen. Saw her weekly up until covid-19. Hoping I will get a slot thurs for my birthday. #lovemyrosie"
1509,2020-06-25,"I am so excited, I just finished my certification for covid tracing, and I am getting my certification for dementia, schizophrenia, life addiction, and Spanish translation. My resume is bout to be popping &lt;3"
1510,2020-06-25,"My mom, shes in a nursing home and I haven't seen her in 5 months due to Covid. I talk to her everyday , as I have my entire life. Her health and dementia has worsened and she is now in hospice. I hope I get the chance to hug her!"
1511,2020-06-25,"Died of what though ? My Nan was in a care home through vascular dementia after a stroke a few years ago, she died 4 weeks ago after another stroke. She tested negative for Covid. So unless you provide evidence for your already vague claim, its meaningless."
1512,2020-06-25,"We took my mom out of her home because she has dementia and can‚Äôt take care of herself. She‚Äôs been in a care facility‚Äîwas in quarantine for a couple of weeks, just got transferred out of quarantine and has now tested positive. It‚Äôs laughably tragic. JFC. #COVID__19"
1513,2020-06-25,I hate dementia and hate covid 19 just as much ! Can‚Äôt see my mum as she‚Äôs in a home life‚Äôs pure shit I want to hug my mum so much but can‚Äôt üò¢
1514,2020-06-25,"Wow, really?! Meanwhile, Coronavirus cases in AZ are skyrocketing and my family doesn‚Äôt have the ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù to stand by my father‚Äôs hospital bed and advocate for him(he has dementia). Hospitals will not allow visitors because of Covid-19. Clearly, he doesn‚Äôt care about Arizonans."
1515,2020-06-25,I so feel your pain. My sister lives in Florida in a nursing home with vascular dementia. No Covid that I‚Äôm aware of but I know I won‚Äôt see her either. The facility is locked down.
1516,2020-06-25,well i just found out my grandpa who has dementia also has covid

1518,2020-06-24,It‚Äôs really sad. One of my friends lost their grandma recently who had dementia and no one could even see her at all let alone say goodbye because of covid. Heart breaking
1519,2020-06-24,"My baby is 79. She has renal failure, congestive heart failure, dementia, Alzheimer‚Äôs, pnuemomia,  and  COVID-19. I took care of her by myself-NO help, didn‚Äôt get sleep, then lived with her in the hospital for 2 months by her bedside. Now all of a sudden, they want to call the shots"
1520,2020-06-24,"My daughter is a home cater for dementia patients, she had 4 when the virus started, she now has 1, 3 died with covid and it broke her heart "

1522,2020-06-24,Just bought my black covid mask like Joes 50% of the proceeds goes to help fund Dementia research
1523,2020-06-24,NY nursing home restrictions have gone on too long. My 90 yr. old father has dementia  and  loneliness can kill worse than any Covid germ. The Dept. of Health needs to allow for visits before they depart this life. Please allow outside visits much like Mass. is right now.
1524,2020-06-24,"My grandfather is in LTC. Diabetic, Dementia, COPD. Received covid diagnosis. Miraculously beat it without even mild pneumonia. The protocols re: visitation not only keep the seniors in care safe, but also the communities where the facilities are located."
1525,2020-06-24,"Same here. My mother in law has ever increasing dementia, which I saw today is being linked to higher mortality rate when coupled with covid. With my belief that we're going down the herd-immunity path (though they'll never actually say that), it's very worrying."
1526,2020-06-24,Thank you my sweet friend ‚ù§ She lost her sister and Mom to cancer years ago. Both so young. Her dad has dementia. Doesn't truly understand what is happening. He has MRSA pneumonia and e coli blood infection. I can't even go visit due to covid üò≠üíî
1527,2020-06-24,"My M-I-L has been ill for a couple days and has refused food. It has been said that the facility will allow family visitation in July. But, with daily new highs of Covid-19 infections I'm thinking it won't happen. #AlzheimersDisease #dementia"
1528,2020-06-24,"How many people have actually died from covid, my mother in law died a couple months ago of dementia, tested NEGATIVE for covid but covid was put on death certificate"
1529,2020-06-24,"There is a very real chance of my father in law dying not from COVID-19, but because of COVID-19. Let him be hugged! Plexi visits  and  dementia don‚Äôt work. His wife, daughter  and  son have taken the test  and  will continue to do so. @MOHKFLA Please help! #ygk"
1530,2020-06-24,"My family is shredded right now, says @rosemarybayer as they watch her mother struggle with dementia and covid, during debate over nursing home bill."
1531,2020-06-24,"Sorry to hear, but I sympathize my mom has dementia too, I have not been able to see her due to Covid-19, I feel guilty and she keeps asking when I‚Äôm coming to visit, it‚Äôs horrible"

1534,2020-06-24,"Yes I agree about covid because my mother in law died a couple months ago, tested negative for covid,she died of dementia but covid was put on death certificate. This is why I don‚Äôt believe none what they say about this particular thing"

1537,2020-06-24,You guys are the best! I just happened to go to my profile to find an old tweet and I was like ‚ÄúHey look at that!‚Äù Ill take the followers because I have a big mouth and live with my teenage son and my mom with dementia. Imagine that during COVID. So engaging with adults üëçüèª
1538,2020-06-24,My 81 year old grandma who lives in a care facility with severe dementia and has a history of TB (she was hospitalized as a child and as a teenage for it) caught COVID in April and recovered! üíï‚ú®
1539,2020-06-24,My mom‚Äôs #dementia has been worse the past two days. She was convinced her doctor told her she had COVID‚Äîshe doesn‚Äôt. She told me today she hasn‚Äôt been eating cookies‚Äîshe has. #Alzheimers isn‚Äôt a linear decline. Some days are better than others.
1540,2020-06-24,No because the mf has dementia  and  is unfit too speak infront of a crowd or debate anyone! Covid 19 was a fucking hoax too crash the economy  and  then you‚Äôve created race war‚Äôs too deflect off democratic crimes! We know you‚Äôre your‚Äôre going to rig the election in order to win!!
1541,2020-06-24,"My mother is in a nursing dementia unit ($14,000 plus/month) and has been isolated in her room since March 12 which is the last time I was allowed to visit. She is 93 and survived Covid-19 but now has ‚ÄúFlat Affect‚Äù because of the isolation and no sign of visitation. Thx Gov."

1543,2020-06-23,"I'd go back to be a care worker for dementia sufferers, i lost my job before covid but honestly i loved it. I considered is a privilege to be able to care for others. It's honestly the only thing i am good at."
1544,2020-06-23,"I live with my elderly mother who has dementia, other chronic underlying health conditions  and  lots of money. She wears my pants, which I object to  and  so I have regular parties.

1545,2020-06-23,"My PawPaw has been battling dementia for some years now. After not seeing him for months due to covid, I finally went over there,  and  he didn't recognize me. Some heartbreak you know is coming but still aren't prepared for"
1546,2020-06-23,My Mother in Law has dementia  and  Covid she is expected to die this week. But not of Covid but with Covid but yeah I expect she will be added to the figures
1547,2020-06-23,So my great grandma has Covid but is asymptotic. Her coughing has stopped and fever is gone. She started eating a small amount and she‚Äôs took one of her meds. She‚Äôs improving but she‚Äôs also 97 with dementia. She‚Äôs given up but Covid still didn‚Äôt take her out
1548,2020-06-23,shout out to my 84 year old grandma with dementia that survived having COVID. the strongest woman i know‚ù§Ô∏è 
1549,2020-06-23,"I can‚Äôt explain to you the relief in my mother‚Äôs negative COVID test. She had to have one for her endoscopy, is in the early stages of dementia, therefore many executive function issues. It‚Äôs been so hard to both keep her safe, and realize how little anyone else gives AF."
1550,2020-06-23,"My grandmother recently died. She had dementia and no mention of covid, even though there were cases in her retirement home. I think it‚Äôs likely."
1551,2020-06-23,"Maybe u could help me, my moms dementia got worse at the time the COVID-19 struck as hard and I‚Äôm having an extremely hard time explaining it to her do you have any suggestions on what I can do or say to help her understand?"
1552,2020-06-23,"#COVID #Cincinnati Just spent 4 hrs on the phone trying to calm my brother down, which is hard because I‚Äôm fighting freaking out myself. He is the sole support for a wife, 55 yrs old with advanced MS and accompanying dementia and seizures- and our 82 yr. old mother.... /1"
1553,2020-06-23,These are 2 faces of COVID. Guess where they contracted? CHURCH!!! Tell my 5 y/o who hasn't seen her GiGi  and  Pap in 3 months. Her Pap is STILL trying to recover from what was expected to be fatal. He has dementia and couldn't remember WHY he was in ICU. Both were near fatality.

1557,2020-06-23,I‚Äôm fine being in 2. My #dementia mom in nursing home probably wouldn‚Äôt survive COVID. Phase 2 restricts visitors and that‚Äôs best right now. The home has 18 cases currently. She tested negative last week. Tests are weekly beginning this week. ü§ûüèªü§ûüèªü§ûüèª
1558,2020-06-23,My grandma finally came home after 3 weeks but was still positive with Covid so they have been trying to keep my grandad away from her. He has dementia and didn‚Äôt know she was home so he saw her today and went in the room and just sat on the floor and they couldn‚Äôt get him out üò¢
1559,2020-06-22,"Our #seniors are victims of #Covid not just because of the virus, but because they are isolated from regular visits. For someone like my Dad with #dementia this is crucial to his well being üòü He has become non-verbal during my absence üòû"
1560,2020-06-22,My friends grandma just died after many years fighting dementia. They got the death certificate and it had COVID as a cause... without a test... they had it removed
1561,2020-06-22,"my grandma has it and she currently has covid-19, i understand your pain, dementia is a horrible thing"
1562,2020-06-22,"I had to hospitalize my Pop 3 different times during The Age Of Rona. Not COVID related, but he‚Äôs got a touch of dementia so he wasn‚Äôt sure what was happening. The worst part was thinking about him alone in a hospital and I couldn‚Äôt give him support. Hope it all works out ok."
1563,2020-06-22,That‚Äôs a good one but I‚Äôm going to say the Dementia. Watched my grandmother and now one of my best friends mother is going through it. COVID will go away one day. I don‚Äôt ever think we will ever be rid of the cruel Dementia. Happy to hear you got to see your dad.xx
1564,2020-06-22,"I got to see my Dad today for the first time in 14 weeks.

1565,2020-06-22,"Yesterday was all the rally news we needed to hear, and Bolton for that matter. Get back to what matters. COVID, economy, PPP, PPE, Barr, McConnell, SCOTUS, dementia, GOP has no platform for 2020."

1567,2020-06-22,I've lost most of my remaining family the last 3 months. I think I've earned the right to be upset and scared of hospital. 3 Covid deaths. My dad due dementia. Dad's death has destroyed me. I spent years looking after him. Sighs

1572,2020-06-22,"my mother-in-law had non-hodgkins, then got dementia, then got COPD. They all had a part and were all equally important in her eventual death. You don't discredit her cancer just because COPD was official COD. Same deal w/covid."
1573,2020-06-22,"My grandma has dementia, doesn't remember COVID, or that my bridal shower was supposed to be in July, or what I look like, but she DOES remember that she promised @JCampbellMcGill she'd make him homemade spaghetti  and  that she still hasn't made good. I am her first grandchild."

1577,2020-06-21,"Same. I‚Äôm really wary of where I go. My dad is in a care home with dementia so I‚Äôve not been allowed to see him since March, my MIL died a month ago (not Covid) but we had to do the 10 people funeral  and  those 2 do what the hell they like."
1578,2020-06-21,Careful about cleaning! My mother got dementia from doing too much of it. #COVID19 #COVID #coronavirus
1579,2020-06-21,I don‚Äôt get this. Sadly care homes have been affected badly but not just in Scotland. Those who know dementia sufferers know it‚Äôs virtually impossible to get them to social distance 24/7. Thankfully my dad‚Äôs home was fully tested weeks ago and covid free.
1580,2020-06-21,"My neighbor was just telling how her sister's partner's mother, has dementia, diagnosed with COVID-19, was told they needed to find another home for her. She was taken out of her home for COVID-19 treatment, and apparently has lost her home in the process."
1581,2020-06-21,"Oh no. So sorry to hear this. My step-father had Lewy Body dementia  and  know what a debilitating disease it is. And then Covid-19 on top of it all. Yes, that‚Äôs a special hell."
1582,2020-06-21,"She'll be fine. My best friend's 98 yr old granda lives in NY, in a nursing home, she has dementia and she got Covid and survived. Yes, they are at a greater risk, but most who are infected, even the elderly, will survive, so why act is if though that is not the case?"
1583,2020-06-21,"Here‚Äôs my father from Christmas 2019. Thanks to Covid-19, I‚Äôm unable to see him today. He has dementia and is rarely awake. Happy Father‚Äôs dad... ‚ù§Ô∏è "

1587,2020-06-21,"Today is our first Father's Day without Dad. My sister @HarrisLucy was interviewed for this piece on people who have lost their dads to covid-19. It's a nice snapshot of who he was before Parkinson's, dementia and covid came along. "

1590,2020-06-21,My grandma has dementia. She also has covid and apparently she keeps ripping out her IVs fighting the nurses wanting to go home and now I know why everyone in my family is hardheaded lol.
1591,2020-06-21,üò±üò±üò±üò≠üò≠üò≠ Yeah appalling that all their grandmammys and grandpappys are going to kick the bucket because they wanted to listen to a rambling idiot with obvious dementia. I hope they fill the air with covid in a huge aerosol cloud that envelops them all üò±üò±üò±
1592,2020-06-20,And my 90 year old brother has had his dementia sky rocket because of the isolation. Had to be moved to a secure facility since he is a flight risk since covid pushed him to the limit. Couldn‚Äôt even go to his new room to help him settle. He‚Äôs surrounded by masked strangers.
1593,2020-06-20,"My #MAGA 80 year old mother believes this covid virus is not a big deal. She thinks the numbers are over inflated, and CDC can‚Äôt be trusted. I‚Äôm so frustrated. Also, my mom has dementia, so it‚Äôs pointless to argue. Just told her I‚Äôm not discussing politics with her."
1594,2020-06-20,"Storytime: My grandfather had lung issues and dementia so wasn't long for this world to begin with. A nurse has the sniffles but went into work anyways at his nursing facility. They end up infecting around 40 people with covid, 20 or so were employees. "
1595,2020-06-20,"My mother has dementia and lives in a nursing home in SC, where she has been on lockdown since 3/11. They had kept COVID at bay, but now with the state reopening and people not wearing masks, staffers have tested positive, so she will be confined to her room."

1743,2020-06-12,"Thinking of my dad a lot at the mo with all the ads for fathers' day. I still miss him even though it is well over a year since he died now. That said, I don't know how I could've coped if he had still been alive, living with dementia in the nursing home during Covid-19 üòî"

1750,2020-06-11,Gets hard to take seriously. My aunt just died of Lewy body dementia bot covidpushed her over the edge. She was 80. I also have a friend (age 50) who was in hospital with another respiratory condition on a ventilator and they pressured him to accept a Covid diagnosis.
1751,2020-06-11,"Aw man I‚Äôm sorry to hear all that. My grandad had dementia and it‚Äôs crazy even without Covid. My Nan is 94, refuses acknowledge anything is going on and doesn‚Äôt give af if her caters wear anything. She‚Äôs even had a DNR put on her record üòÇ. We have no hope lol."

1758,2020-06-11,God you talk bollocks @piersmorgan . My wife‚Äôs mother died this year with COVID.. She was in the advance stages of Dementia. She was weak and frail. I fully understand the reasoning . This is why the excess deaths may not be as high as you make them out to be for the year.
1759,2020-06-11,Why are you pandering to him? My wife‚Äôs mother died this year with COVID..She was in the advance stages of Dementia. We both fully understand your reasoning.
1760,2020-06-11,Great question.. I cared for my dad for 11yrs..recently passed from covid 19 and advanced dementia. 20 days off in 11 yrs. He needed 2 carers at all times due to hse hoist regulations. I'd do it all again.government are wrong to think you can take a day off youve got family.
1761,2020-06-11,I've been saying for weeks..as an unpaid carer and campaigner of 25yrs..there should be a specific dementia covid plan..and I want to read it. Yet again 'D means disappeared! I cared for my dad who died of covid. Until hospital and passing. No contact is humain. Life changing.
1762,2020-06-11,Just read the article and it's an absolute disgrace what he is spouting. My dad could have lived a few more years with his dementia but covid 19 took him. He was 76 and as a family didn't have anything to do with the death certificate. Hes an absolute joke x
1763,2020-06-11,"It's true, my mother is in a dementia care home, as much as I didn't want her to get Covid 19,i also knew that a bad cold could potentially kill her or in fact natural causes at any time. She actually has just come through 2 1/2 weeks with Covid, the Professor is 100% correct"
1764,2020-06-11,Why would it hurt people? My mum died in a care home at the start of lockdown she had dementia and died of a water infection. I‚Äôm pleased she didn‚Äôt die of COVID-19 and have to suffer as I‚Äôve seen on TV.
1765,2020-06-11,"It really feels like a portion of the population, we're not supposed to care about their deaths. They're less worthy, or disposable somehow. I imagine someone with dementia or terminal cancer also suffering with end stage severe Covid-19 and my heart breaks."
1766,2020-06-11,My mother was probably one of those deaths now being identified as the unusual spike in dementia deaths this Spring. We know she didn't have Covid-19 even though she wasn't tested as her GP visited her during her last 48 hours several times to do obs. Karol Sikora is a disgrace.
1767,2020-06-11,"I was due to attend my first meeting but sadly it was cancelled.

1770,2020-06-11,A lesser-known complication from the COVID crisis is its effect on our elderly - not the disease itself but the mitigations that we have attempted. My grandmother - completely able-bodied but crippled by dementia - has become a completely different person bc of this crisis.
1771,2020-06-10,"my babcia has dementia, and there are moments when she remembers who we are and moments when she doesn't. but even if she didn't know us today, she was happy to see us and happy to wave back at us. I miss her dearly. I can't wait for COVID to be finished so I can visit her again."

1781,2020-06-10,Because the hospitals are adding to the Figures by reporting people who died with covid19 not people who died of the virus. My sister's a nurse and she's had patients die of dementia and cancer and because they've got covid 19 that's what goes on the death certificate.
1782,2020-06-10,This is an excellent opportunity for all Early Career Researchers working in dementia research in Scotland. @sdrc_research are offering funding to support those whose research has been affected by COVID-19. @UWSAcademy @MJSmith0611 @angelagregory28

1788,2020-06-10,My Mother with dementia turned 91 today was hospitalized 4 wks ago amid the COVID-19 hysteria.After one day the hospital allowed me in to be with her because she would not take meds. It saved her life. She is hone now doing well. Thank God for the common sense of this Hospital!

1790,2020-06-09,I know this from personal experience with my mom who had #dementia and was confused by #coronavirus lockdown in her nursing home even before she contracted #COVID__19. So many layers of additional pain and confusion for people with memory loss and their caregivers and loved ones
1791,2020-06-09,"Anyway. Today I'm thinking about how my COVID-limbo life right now is a lot like having a parent with dementia. I have to mourn things that aren't officially gone yet, and the urge to just put it all off as long as possible is often overwhelming."
1792,2020-06-09,"My last weekend and days. I had a elderly family member fall, he has dementia. I had a scare for a few days that we could be positive for Covid because of the dumb actions of someone else. I've felt criticized because of something I'm doing in my private life."

1803,2020-06-08,This happened with my grandfather and my mom. He has dementia and needs mom there to help. Because of covid they wouldn‚Äôt let her and he had a bad episode in the office.
1804,2020-06-08,"Having a loved one with dementia is hard enough. But with this pandemic, it is especially challenging. My mother has dementia, and I I have been diagnosed with COVID. It's a nightmare. My heart is with you. You are not alone, especially in your sadness."
1805,2020-06-08,"At a time when charities have been hit incredibly hard and people living with dementia are struggling more than most due to COVID-19, i'm extremely grateful to @ARUKscientist for funding my research. Together we can defeat dementia. @UoDMedicine"
1806,2020-06-08,"Also think about folks like my 87 year old Vet Dad who couldn‚Äôt go with my 84 year old Mom w/dementia last month when she broke her hip, on a Thursday night. He couldn‚Äôt visit her in the hospital until Saturday b/c of Covid precaution (control)ü§¨ "
1807,2020-06-08,"Hi Kelly, I'm so sorry for your loss. I'm writing a piece for a broadsheet newspaper on this subject - about the link between dementia and Covid and was wondering if you'd be OK to talk to me about what happened to your dad for the piece. My email is lauren.libbert@me.com. Thanks"

1809,2020-06-08,"Even when someone has dementia, it‚Äôs not death by dementia on the cert. my dad died at the beginning of covid . He had dementia. But he died from ARDS complicated by pneumonia. Not because he had covid. But because he aspirated because he could no longer swallow efficiently."
1810,2020-06-08,Thank you. My mum died from head injuries inflicted by another patient. A group of dementia patients were left unsupervised. A care needs assessment for my mum was hidden from the care home to facilitate a placement to free bed for Covid patients. She was never going to be safe!
1811,2020-06-08,My dad has dementia.He rang to tell me all excited that Melbourne beat Collingwood by ten points in the Qb match today he‚Äôd just watched on the idiot box. Didnt have the heart to tell him it was a tv COVID replay.GO @melbournefc
1812,2020-06-08,#Lyme #dementia is listed in ICD codes but patients are never assessed for it or treated with simple antibiotics that are required. #Azithromycin + #hydroxychloriquine @raoult_didier treatment for covid saves lives. #Alzheimers research needs to do better.
1813,2020-06-08,"My mother‚Äôs 90, beginning dementia. My wife  and  I retired from driving buses to care for her. She loves to travel still but then Covid-19 hit  and  2 weeks ago she broke her hip. I promised her we‚Äôd travel if she could walk again  and  she can! RV is the safest way for her #campingworld"
1814,2020-06-08,"So sorry. My dad, who was in the late stages of dementia, died from COVID a couple weeks ago. Although incredibly sad, it may be a less horrible death than the dementia alternative... being strapped down for an interminable amount of time."
1815,2020-06-08,Sending üôèüôèüôè up for your brother. My twin recently survived COVID renal failure. He's a Vietnam Vet with dementia also. I have felt your pain. God bless both of you.

1829,2020-06-07,This virus confuses me Karol lad...if there are no definate anti bodies then why is there no 2nd wave ? Does this mean the virus has mutated to a lower strain ? Also after being told dementia was the biggest risk my grandmas care home had covid and not 1 died!!! #covid19

1831,2020-06-07,The problem with taking my father-in-law (who has serious dementia) out in the time of COVID is: he is pathologically unable to stop touching every single thing.
1832,2020-06-07,I haven't seen one of my grandmothers in months because I'm trying to protect her from COVID. I used to see her every Saturday. but she's nearly ninety and has dementia and is immunocompromised because she can't leave the house.
1833,2020-06-07,"My M-I-L has Advanced Vascular Dementia, is on End of Life care, tested COVID+, yet seems to be getting over it! You wouldn‚Äôt do it to a dog."
1834,2020-06-07,"2/2.with a crisis workforce theres little time for real training #dementia. I advised those who cared for my dad #hospital daily. They accepted covid 19 was new to them but not dementia.'He wont eat"" ""he wont take meds""..he didnt lose his rights due to covid he just couldnt tell "
1835,2020-06-07,This needs addressing in wales. The cross party group on dementia and DOIIG should convene virtual meetings to address the impact. The covid 19 wrecking ball may have knocked down blocks built during the action plan. My recent experience has identified many points. 1/2 
1836,2020-06-07,"I've never seen someone I like ""spiral into insanity"" but did watch as my mother's dementia took over. I had gotten her to sometimes feed herself when covid came. After being with her every day for a year I had to watch over Zoom as her life slipped away.... 1/2"
1837,2020-06-07,"My grandmother was in a home because of dementia. I say was because she passed away 2 weeks ago. Like you, we couldn‚Äôt visit since March. However, this is why. Out of the 101 residents there, 62 had Covid-19. 22 deaths and 28 staff members tested positive. It wasn‚Äôt safe for us."
1838,2020-06-06,"As the MD daughter of a dad with dementia, I hear you. One of my fears in COVID is what you describe. Sending you prayers and support through the cosmos. Know you are a wonderful daughter."
1839,2020-06-06,My Aunt was assaulted by a dementia patient in her LTC. The other patient has long wandered and been aggressive. My Aunt and Uncle have repeatedly asked that she be kept out of my Aunt's room but even when there were active COVID infections the woman was permitted to wander.
1840,2020-06-06,"Mike, I‚Äôm in the group regarding the ten at a funeral etc. My nan died in a care home. I won‚Äôt lie - I have my doubts over if it was the dementia and resulting effects or if it was COVID-19 as it was on the cusp of lockdown - I don‚Äôt believe government acted fast enough (1/2)"
1841,2020-06-06,"My mums private care home, already in financial difficulties, had PPE as I checked before lockdown. She and a number of others died of covid. Staff were told not to wear masks, changed when covid appeared, I assume to not scare dementia residents. Residents restricted to rooms."
1842,2020-06-06,I‚Äôve been told a member of both mine and my wife had covid on the D cert 1 was 94 18 years dementia and the other serious heart problems 75
1843,2020-06-06,They tried to do the same with me when my momma went to the hospital. She has dementia and according to the law it's her right to have a representative with her. Their covid 19 bs didn't stand a chance against the law!
1844,2020-06-06,"At a time when care and support is reduced, lack of real knowledge has never been so evident. And there are also ethical questions in relation to DNA CPR in relation to persons living with dementia with covid. We were told they wouldn't recusatate Or icu my dad. Sadly passed! "

1847,2020-06-06,"Just read @kategarraway harrowing story in @TheSun. The strength and love she and her family have is immense . Watching my dad caught in his silent dementia bubble, with covid reminded me of their pain. Best wishes and love to kate, Derek and all their family x x x x"

1850,2020-06-06,Ive been blu all my life but all cities looting and burning are blu. I'm Indep.The dems cant win. They once again cheated any decent options and placed a corrup man w dementia. They want to keep kids from going back to school on the Covid lie to keep us from voting in person w id

1867,2020-06-05,"Why we must help our charities more.The link between Dementia and Covid is clear.

1872,2020-06-05,"Robert this is tragic my own father died of a Dementia related illness but you do need to be careful quoting this information, there are a very large number of people who have died with Covid on their death certificate without a confirmation test"
1873,2020-06-05,"Not in Scotland, or not for my mum anyway, who had advanced dementia, in a care home, and the death certificate says likely Covid as the main cause. 12 others died the same week."
1874,2020-06-05,"Oh please what are you trying to say now The majority of people in care homes have dementia. My mother has dementia and is in a nursing home, no COVID19 she is still alive Approx. 1/3rd of care homes have had COVID outbreaks. Some may have died from COVID others died naturally"
1875,2020-06-05,"It is concerning for sure and it‚Äôs broken my heart to see the dire situation in care homes where a member of my extended family with dementia died with Covid. Much more to do to protect the most vulnerable, including people with dementia."
1876,2020-06-05,I certainly am not kidding myself everything was okay before COVID. Health and Social care are hugely underfunded and this government has neglected the most vulnerable for many years. Change needs to happen to ensure dignity for those with dementia.
1877,2020-06-05,That's how many people die with dementia without COVID as the swallow reflex gets confused. My Uncle died as they tried to dislodge food from his windpipe in an unfamiliar hospital. A good death is so important but don't kid yourself it was all ok before this.
1878,2020-06-05,"My grandad's death cert listed the uncontrollable cancer he was already suffering with, alongside dementia and the COVID which finally took him. And it happened literally in one day. "
1879,2020-06-05,"My husband works on a dementia nursing unit at a care home. On Monday, 3 residents tested positive Covid-19 on his unit. The staff fought to get the rest tested. Now 21 out of 25 are now positive. Sadly, 2 passed away last night. The Tory laissez-faire approach is killing people."
1880,2020-06-05,"During the 7 years my father suffered horrendously with Vascular Dementia and Alzheimer's, I have no doubt whatsoever that he'd have seen Covid as a welcome friend. "
1881,2020-06-05,Anyone with dementia in the family or experience of working with it can probably give a myriad of ways in which COVID-19 has created this situation. 
1882,2020-06-05,"ONS reveals, beyond deaths directly linked to Covid-19, 83% more deaths from dementia than usual in April, charities warning reduction in essential medical care and family visits were taking a devastating toll. My dad died of dementia  and  I can't imagine how awful it must be now üòî"
1883,2020-06-05,Very perceptive. This is exactly the situation I found myself in with my mum who died of COVID. Factor in that people with dementia are often surprisingly cunning escape artists. Latterly she became very blank due to the lack of stimulation and didn‚Äôt even understand Skype calls
1884,2020-06-05,My stepmother with vascular dementia in a specialist care home at ¬£5200 per month lost her life to covid. There are no words
1885,2020-06-05,"The same happened to me. My gradma died in NY, not because of COVID, but bc dementia, and we were not allowed to have a funeral. Again, criminals have more rights in this country than good citizens."
1886,2020-06-05,Yes. Thank you for your work on this. My mother died of covid on Sunday aged 84. She was the first in her IOW care home (dementia section) to feel unwell. It only took 5 days. She was physically fit. A retired ophthalmologist (set up her own practice in 1963). A very lovely soul.
1887,2020-06-05,"An excellent thread that well explains the challenges my family have faced with trying to support my dad, 83 w dementia, through the covid crisis. Please read  and  share this thread. The underfunding of the care system must not continue. "
1888,2020-06-05,"We are lucky dear resister, my mom is a beautiful soul too. Glad your mom‚Äôs ok. My mom has dementia and in a nursing care home and still no COVID-19 cases. The ppl there are very careful and careing. Our mom‚Äôs taught us to love and respect all people. I love my mom madly too‚ô•Ô∏è‚òÆÔ∏è "
1889,2020-06-05,"This is a really horrible thing to say and I hope people understand where I'm coming from - but I am almost relieved my grandparents with dementia who lived in care homes passed away before all of this, because COVID-19 would have been unspeakably hard on them. "
1890,2020-06-04,"You make some great points - don‚Äôt disagree with your motivation. But right now, I haven‚Äôt seen my mum for 3 months - before I saw her every day. She‚Äôs bed bound with dementia, in a nursing home that‚Äôs had Covid cases. If there‚Äôs a 2nd spike, I won‚Äôt see her for months more."
1891,2020-06-04,"My Mum and Dad have dementia and in the same care home. Mum had a cough, so was tested for COVID-19 and was isolated along with Dad, in their room for a few days until result came through (Negative fortunately). Dad was going spare at being shut in. I've not seen them for 14 wks"
1892,2020-06-04,"Thanks for your long & insightful thread. My wife has Fronto Temporal Dementia  and  lives in a care home. Saw her for first time in 10 weeks on Tues: no sign that she knew me. It was bound to happen but Covid-19 forced separation has hastened cognitive decline, despite superb carers"
1893,2020-06-04,"Now by twist of fate, my daughter is a carer. She was at a home for dementia patients, now works with those with brain injuries. However the same issues apply. Patients at her home have died from Covid, staff have been effected, some have left. But at she says they need her."
1894,2020-06-04,"As a lot of you know my dad has dementia and my mum (a nurse) is his primary carer. They both had Covid pretty much concurrently and it was tough on them both and me, who couldn't get to them. It was a horrid week. They got very little help. "
1895,2020-06-04,"If my 90 yo gm was still alive and died of covid, yes. When she did pass she had very little qol and it was merciful. Dementia too. It was an awful way to live"
1896,2020-06-04,"Thank you for your reporting on the care home situation. My father was in a care home with dementia until he passed away last year, and I can totally see how people with dementia in care homes would be hugely impacted by the necessary covid response impacts. It's terrible."
1897,2020-06-04,"My dad's Alzheimer's is slowly getting worse. His brother died of Covid in April, having just moved into a nursery home for dementia patients in Stockholm. This thread explains so well why dementia sufferers are so vulnerable now. "
1898,2020-06-04,"I got that when @grantshapps mid COVID briefing today suddenly started talking about electric cars, greener, cleaner cities  and  how no one wants to go back to the old normal as though he speaks for everyone. My Mum is 82 with dementia even she said why is he talking about this?"
1899,2020-06-04,Lost my Dad to COVID in a care home (no test) I‚Äôm convinced his dementia became much worse due to isolation and staff unable to communicate effectively due to PPE

1901,2020-06-04,"See thread. My father-in-law just died from Covid while suffering Dementia. Actually, he was the first Covid fatality in our county. "
1902,2020-06-04,Praying for you brother. I lost my dad 3 years ago to dementia and my mom passed away in March with what we now believe was COVID-19 So I know the feeling of loss.
1903,2020-06-04,And my brother who has dementia is in a veterans nursing facility that has had 31 veteran deaths from Covid since the end of March. It‚Äôs not over and people need to know that and still keep themselves and others safe.
1904,2020-06-04,I work in a school district & lost my 2nd job & summer job due to COVID. I have no income for the summer  and  I spend about $200 a month on my sr dogs arthritis  and  dementia medication. Not to mention her parasite prevention! Please help! $carriehixson

1906,2020-06-04,The Government Covid policy sent my mother to her violent death! Discharged from hospital to care home without adequate checks on safety. She was old had dementia so was expendable! Died from head injuries inflicted by another patient! 
1907,2020-06-04,"My 95 year old grandmother with dementia has also recovered, 10 in her home have sadly died from covid."

1909,2020-06-04,My 92 year old father is a victim of the Covid 19. He did not catch the virus but 10 weeks of no social interaction  and  listening to doom  and  gloom everyday on CNN has taken a mild case of early dementia and sped up his decline now in nursing facility and I cannot visit. Why?
1910,2020-06-04,My mum who had dementia was discharged by the NHS to a care home to free up beds for Covid patients. I received a call telling me my mother would be transferred within the hour. I told them the care home would not be able to keep her safe but they wouldn‚Äôt listen. This is what -

1913,2020-06-04,My father passed away yesterday. He was eighty-six years old. He placed a nursing home since last December. Because he began to have dementia little by little. my mother couldn't take care of him. The last time I saw him was the mid December. That's why the covid-19.

1921,2020-06-03,My Nan contracted Covid in a care home. She was moved to a hospital where she recovered. Unfortunately the virus expedited her dementia. There's talk of palliative care.
1922,2020-06-03,Well that's mee 100 quid lighter cos the cat can't pee. Then just heard my sister's f-i-l who's in hospital with Covid has slipped into an unresponsive state. He'd rallied the last couple of days and was off oxygen. He has Parkinson's and dementia too. What a crap day üò©

2018,2020-05-29,"My Mum, 87, dementia, paying ¬£1,200 per week for her care because the care system has been privatised is entitled to expect the person in charge to confirm that the Govt policy of discharging Covid + patients into care homes, putting her life at risk, will be stopped."
2019,2020-05-29,"Meanwhile my Uncle can‚Äôt visit his wife of over 63yrs she has dementia and now #COVID__19 he has personally looked after her 24hrs for 6yrs - no help, she is hospitalised and he is not allowed to see her, she is confused and scared and he is #heartbroken #DominicCummnings"
2020,2020-05-29,"I don‚Äôt really know how this is relevant to the discourse but it feels like it should be and I keep thinking about it, so I‚Äôm going to mention it. My nan is in a specialist dementia care home. It is (allegedly) covid free and has been for weeks now 1/?"
2021,2020-05-29,"My mom just asked what kind of cases/stress I‚Äôve been having this week, and as I rattled off the summaries (super-obesity + poverty, teenage psychosis, slowly dying COVID patients, dementia patients attacking family, hospice referrals for people with no one but a conservator..)"
2022,2020-05-29,"My grandpa passed away this morning. He was 94. Married to my grandma for 70 years. She has dementia and I‚Äôm not sure she understands who he is anymore. Because of Covid, he died alone in his room at the nursing home. And it just feels so sad and unfair. "
2023,2020-05-29,"At my dad's nursing home, 41/72 residents have tested positive for COVID. 3/41 are dementia patients living downstairs with my dad (until today there were 0). You can't tell dementia patients to isolate, to not put on one another's clothes. It will spread like wildfire down there"
2024,2020-05-28,"My 84 year old dad is in a care home,haven't been able to see him for 2 months now,he has dementia aswel so he is very confused by it all,theyve had people sent to them from hospitals after having covid 19,this government don't give a fuck about old people.."
2025,2020-05-28,"To the best of my knowledge, he did NOT just get back from India, and he did NOT just beat Covid, unless he had a mild version of the disease and didn't tell us??? If he doesn't remember WHEN he went to India, what does that say about his state of mind/mental health? Dementia? "
2026,2020-05-28,We have put 2.5 years into a clinical trial @BW for my 67 yo dad w dementia. Now he hasn‚Äôt had treatment in over 2 months and is declining rapidly! Open the hospitals for the health of people @risk of things besides COVID! Enough is enough! #OpenAmericaNOW #reopenMA #boston
2027,2020-05-28,Prob should keep it to myself tbh someone could of just lost a loved one to covid or dementia and I am posting stupidly. Maybe I should think what a day that cld be read by hundreds as apples to in small groups. I blame my shit sense of humour and ignorance to others
2028,2020-05-28,"Exactly. like for the ppl that just beat #Covid_19 I am drowning in medical bill and the fact that I take care of my sick dad Who's a veteran with diabetes, alcoholism, manic bipolar, depression and anxiety,hoarder, and dementia.Bc he has let the house get so bad they will condemn it.#help"
2029,2020-05-28,"And for all of you who are replying with nasty or mocking comments: I just received a call that my father‚Äôs nursing home has confirmed its first positive case of COVID. I haven‚Äôt seen my father in months. He has dementia, and doesn‚Äôt quite understand what‚Äôs going on."
2030,2020-05-28,If my nan had died in a care home & gone down as Covid I'd be fuming. Somehow she's survived it all  and  still has Dementia
2031,2020-05-28,My grandad lives in a council-run care home. Some of the other blocks have had COVID cases but as far as I know the one my grandad lives in hasn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not sure. He has dementia and is partially deaf so it‚Äôs hard to get information. Mum is worried sick about him. So am I. üò°üî•
2032,2020-05-28,"Tonight, I'm specifically clapping for my cousin, Suzanne. She cares for dementia patients with covid. She finishes her 12 hr shift at 8pm and drives past ppl clapping on street corners, often arriving home in tears "
2033,2020-05-28,"I'm not so sure it is bullshit, my Nan died of dementia (she was 94) in a care home, we were told that if a case of Covid had been recorded at the care home, her death certificate may have had it on it. Luckily no cases had been recorded there. Seemed crazy logic to us."
2034,2020-05-28,"Even with no deaths on the roads, that's only 300 for 10 weeks of lockdown. I suspect its not ""lockdown"" directly but PHE reported an unknown infection in care homes - my bet is something brought from hospitals, like Covid killing very elderly dementia residents."
2035,2020-05-28,"Covid positive staff and residents started showing up in my Mom's nursing home. It's just a matter of time now, isn't it? She has dementia, and is in a wheelchair, so no, she wasn't going out to get her hair done."
2036,2020-05-28,"Hello. On top of COVID and dementia, my grandmother was diagnosed with cancer last night ‚Äî and it‚Äôs not looking great right now. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever be able to talk to or see her again, so if you could please keep her in your thoughts I‚Äôd appreciate it. Thank you."
2037,2020-05-28,"Matt, me & my family distraught- my mum (78 with Parkinson‚Äôs & Lewy Body dementia) was in Southport Hospital for over 2wks none Covid  and  on Saturday she was moved to a care home for ‚Äòrehabilitation‚Äô without ANY prior consultation or communication with family üòû"
2038,2020-05-28,True actually my friends dad was in hospital for dementia he caught the virus in the hospital which was in London. He was recovering but sadly he died on Monday. Hospitals are just as much a risk. Truth is many people have other illnesses and die with covid not because of it.
2039,2020-05-28,"The horrendous number of Covid-19 deaths in the UK includes that of my 96 year old uncle who died a month ago in a care home for dementia patients. Every life is precious, but my own government doesn't care."
2040,2020-05-28,"Before covid-19, my elderly parents and I were shopping for a ""forever home"" to all live together. My dad with dementia and my mom unsteady with walking. Almost none of the houses around here will be forever homes because they aren't designed for the later stages of life."
2041,2020-05-28,I agree with Emma I listen every evening and really enjoy the manner in which the programme is put together. My husband has Parkinsons with dementia and is in lock down in an excellent care home. They do have Covid in the home and the Newscast helps me keep perspective.
2042,2020-05-28,I'm an actor so all work ended when lockdown began. I decided to throw myself into lino printing for the first time since school. I set up a tiny studio in the garden shed. A few weeks later we lost my dad to covid after years of living with Parkinson's and dementia.
2043,2020-05-28,Yesterday I lost my mom. Due to covid I was unable to see her for the last few months. I did get to FaceTime twice and we did chat on the phone until her dementia made it difficult for her to do so. There will be no memorial until NJ is cleared to do so. My heart is broken. ‚ù§Ô∏èüíï
2044,2020-05-28,"That's awful - I'm here in Qld - my MIL is in dementia care, but in a place where it's usually easy (closed during Covid measures) for my FIL to enjoy ease of access. All the care homes around here have husbands and wives together unless there is a medical impediment."
2045,2020-05-28,Such sad news. Dementia is an awful disease - to have Covid as well? Your dad will be watching over you Dean - telling everyone in heaven proudly ‚Äòthat‚Äôs my son the Villa Manager‚Äô. Take care. HEITS
2046,2020-05-28,I feel bad for my mother she‚Äôs got dementia end of life caught Covid and had to go to hospital alone and scared I and family went by the guidelines. What I should have done is been a better son and found a loophole which seems to be government advice what a mug I am.
2047,2020-05-28,Thank you for this. I saw too much elder abuse in facilities when my husband was in them with dementia. Now it is even more important our elderly have protection since their caregivers cannot visit due to COVID.
2048,2020-05-27,The mother of my best friend from college passed away yesterday from Covid. She was 90  and  had dementia  and  Parkinsons. In many ways her death was a blessing. What was not a blessing was no anointing  and  no family. She deserved better at the moment of her death. 1/
2049,2020-05-27,"My brother-in-law‚Äôs grandmother died, last night. She was in an elderly facility, but it was not COVID-19 related. She had been suffering from dementia. She was so kind, especially when my Dad died."
2050,2020-05-27,Being realistic a lot of those people were in their last weeks to 6 months. For those like my cousin's aunt with severe dementia that stopped her eating (POSS COVID as Cause 2 on death cert) it was a blessed release for her and relatives. But others def went before their time.
2051,2020-05-27,"My Mum who had dementia died after contracting Covid 19 from staff or district nurse in care home that was in lockdown. Staff not wearing PPE. She died in hospital Easter Sunday without me, I was not able to be with her or reassure her that I loved her. üíîüò¢üïØ"
2052,2020-05-27,My great auntie has been ill for weeks and has had dementia for years. She died peacefully in her sleep last Friday. Her death certificate: covid 19. She wasn't even tested!!!!!!! What does this tell you about the death figures!!!! How many deaths have been forged as covid19.
2053,2020-05-27,My great auntie has been ill for weeks and has had dementia for years. She died peacefully in her sleep last Friday. Her death certificate: covid 19. She wasn't even tested!!!!!!! What does this tell you about the death figures!!!!
2054,2020-05-27,"This is wonderful to hear. I lost my great aunt in NY because of Covid patients being let into nursing homes. Just two days after her 102nd birthday. She was healthy, only suffering from dementia. I will never forgive our governor for this."
2055,2020-05-27,"As the grandson of 3 parents that battled dementia as they passed, you have my sympathy. But not seeing loved ones is NOT going to cause dementia. Giving them COVID might kill them, though. Be responsible-find a way to check in on her."
2056,2020-05-27,No @BorisJohnson we are interested in #cummings and one rule for him and another for us. I‚Äôm interested in my uncle who died alone in a care home probably covid and had no family at his funeral. I‚Äôm interested in my 87 year old mum who has dementia who I haven‚Äôt seen for months.
2057,2020-05-27,We bought a #bedalarm for dad and it‚Äôs working great. It makes the most wonderful sound when you‚Äôve just fallen asleep to let you know dad is up again. ;) #ILoveMyDad #webroughthimhome #covid #caregivers #dementia #Alzheimers #limitedmobility #seniordevices #longtermcarecrisis
2058,2020-05-27,"If u ever get a scientist/gov min on plz can u ask this! My dad tested covid+ 4 wks ago, he has dementia  and  been at 4 dif hospitals/nursing homes. Hes been retested now after 2 wks not in isolation! Hes positive! Is he infectious still?!"
2059,2020-05-27,I work SAR so I‚Äôm very aware of how dementia works. Plus my own mother died from AD. So she was never dx w/Covid? Any temp spikes? PNA?
2060,2020-05-27,"Hi @BBCSpringwatch - here's another wonderful @DementiaTweets, in which @FrancesIsaacs7 (who lives w #dementia) describes the beautiful Welsh landscape and how it gives her solace in these #COVID__19 times... ""It just restores my soul"""

2063,2020-05-27,"Hey, complete strangers on the internet. My dad has gone from early onset dementia to full dementia while his mother is in palliative care with covid 19, and we can't be with her...I was wondering. Would you all be so cool as to send me funny ass shit?"
2064,2020-05-27,"Inspiring blog from John Yip, CEO of Kensington Health. ""I can't ask the staff to do something I won't do myself"". Read how he fed residents on the dementia ward and the heart wrenching experience of leading during COVID. Thank you John! @Skippyho8"
2065,2020-05-27,"Not a new issue, perhaps compounded by Covid-19. My husband's grandma died in a private home 3 yrs ago. A few days before her passing her diamond and ruby ring was 'lost'. Mngmt did not investigate due to her dementia; it was suggested she gifted it to a staff member and forgot."
2066,2020-05-27,"America waking up. Only 50% say they'll willingly accept covid vaccine (was gonna call it Kool-aid, but hey, to each their own. I want to live to old age without IBS and/or dementia ...my flu-shot-fanatic mom has both, neither runs in family/genetic)."
2067,2020-05-27,One of my facilities that was hit HARD (all dementia) has now lost 2 CNA's to COVID. One had been a CNA for 14yrs in same spot. That is dedication! The other - a mother to 4 young kids. She was sick bf we knew all the residents had it. Exposing herself daily on their behalf. 
2068,2020-05-27,"As my father ages, he becomes more of a right-winger nut that thinks everything is a social attack from the left, including Covid-19. Is this a beginning sign of dementia? Or are old people just stubborn and the worst‚Ñ¢Ô∏è?"
2069,2020-05-27,#Covid_19 #theprofit what I learned. That I do not not have much of a life. With the job I have not much changed with it during Covid_19. The biggest thing that got to me was trying to see my mother in a Alzheimer‚Äôs an dementia care facility now in memory care. It did not happen!
2070,2020-05-26,"This is stupid! He didn‚Äôt create the Covid-19 virus. He can‚Äôt end it, he is not god. What is fake about? My younger sister is in a ventilator fighting for her life. Hundreds of thousands have sided in a few months. What‚Äôs fake about it? Are you suffering from dementia? "
2071,2020-05-26,"My grandmother back in the old country survived the war a a teenager. She suffered from dementia for the last few years. She is 91. When the family was talking about Covid horrors, she interjected: ‚ÄúDuring the was we lived away from the front. We each got 8pz of rye bread"
2072,2020-05-26,"Just to say goodby to my lovely husband, only wish I could have seen him. As well as Dementia the Covid Virus got into the home and like many other elderly residents it wiped them out. RIP to all the elderly who have ended up with this dreadful disease. Ceciliax"
2073,2020-05-26,The media cares more that a white woman said mean words to a black man than a black man mercilessly beating 2 white dementia stricken nursing home patients with COVID-19 after he had a YouTube channel talking about hatred of whites. #CentralParkKaren #AmyCooper #EnemyOfThePeople
2074,2020-05-26,"Sorry for your loss. My story is similar. I‚Äôm a key worker & was forbidden from visiting my mum who was suffering with Parkinson‚Äôs & Dementia. Whilst Covid didn‚Äôt directly kill her I have no doubt the confusion, isolation  and  fretting did. She simply gave up. All the best to you."
2075,2020-05-26,"So my family member who passed of Covid and was the only one of four in a care home to get it. She only had dementia, no other risk factors."
2076,2020-05-26,My mother spent the last few years of her life in CHSLDs while battling dementia before she passed away four years ago. Those places were horrible back then. If one good thing comes out of COVID-19 it might be that now everyone knows how bad senior residences have become.
2077,2020-05-26,The virus is a hoax...My mom just died of dementia...They put COVID... Although she tested negative...The entire thing is a scam! Wake-Up!
2078,2020-05-26,I'm still thinking about the person last week who told me she'd rather die in her 70s of COVID than in her 90s of dementia. And my only response is I'd rather not die from exposure to you in my 50s.
2079,2020-05-26,"My Mum‚Äôs nursing home locked down well before advice, and all residents are no longer using communal areas in her section (advanced dementia). I do wonder when I will ever get to see her again? (I‚Äôm currently working in COVID ITU on redeployment)."

2082,2020-05-26,I am excited to share that my last perspective focusing on how this catastrophic atmosphere of COVID-19 effects Alzheimer's patients is out in CNR. @BenthamScienceP Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is penetrating to dementia research 
2083,2020-05-26,"I would be interested in her opinion on the nursing home controversy--keeping elderly dementia patients w/covid hospitalized vs transferring back, especially considering hospital delirium. I link to a study on Covid and delirium in my piece on the subject: "
2084,2020-05-26,"Lost my dad about a month ago (to dementia, not Covid) - funeral in UK only 6 people in attendance. Myself, OH and my (adult) kids (Dad's only grandkids) watched it from Aus on Livestream. Never imagined such a thing. I'm over 2020, totally over it."
2085,2020-05-26,"My grandad hasn't died of covid yet btw. But my mum said last night the fact he's fully confirmed to have it means he can't go back to his care home at all, even if he survives it? Wtf lol. Where is the 80 year old with dementia and serious care needs gonna go????"
2086,2020-05-26,My Mom passed away on April 15th from a long battle with dementia (so not Covid related). That has pretty much leveled meüòî
2087,2020-05-26,"We married in 1970, as well! My husband passed away a few days ago, victim of Covid protocol! He had dementia, didn‚Äôt understand why I couldn‚Äôt visit him. He lost hope, 36 lbs in 23 days; could not be saved. This is so cruel to do to our seniors/he was a veteran!!! WRONG!!!"
2088,2020-05-25,"My estimation is closer to 80 million... but the Dems are using sophisticated tools to manipulate minds of people apparently, how else can you explain voting for a nominee with dementia, a terrible record, and out of sight (even before covid) "
2089,2020-05-25,"MEANWHILE: My roomies grandmother has covid and is undulating in condition with a room mate at a facility in florida. She's got dementia fight but still. No, the data does not match anecdotal. Hope im wrong!"
2090,2020-05-25,"You don't put them in common nursing homes that are ""storage"" maintenance instead of critical care... if in Detroit, don't put 20 yr old boxer wannabees with 75yr, Army dementia patients. Will likely lower the 75% Nursing home fatality rate in my county with 59% COVID in VA."
2091,2020-05-25,"I'm not excusing anyone's behaviour but kinnock did not have COVID-19 and did not travel 500 miles round trip, plus 60 more to local beauty spot on his wife's bday. I haven't seen my kids, g'kids and have isolated from my husband so I can look after my mil with dementia."

2093,2020-05-25,"Sorry Matt. Totally disagree with you. My sister in care home in somerset has covid 19 and dementia she's 62. This is serious and not acceptable he didn't stay at home and he ""tested his eyesight"". Start leading by example. You are better than this. PLEASE"
2094,2020-05-25,I haven‚Äôt seen my Gran who is 91 with Dementia because of Covid risk. There‚Äôs a strong chance she‚Äôll forget me and the rest of my family. We‚Äôve isolated as per the Gov instructions and now they make a complete mockery of us all. Disgusted!
2095,2020-05-25,"Trust the NHS? They wrongfully discharged my dad (who suffers from dementia) back into a care home early on Saturday morning, without a Covid test, shoes or his meds. They've taken him back in today, as they've realised they got it wrong. They're not infallible."
2096,2020-05-25,"No, my Mum died peacefully from dementia/old age in 2018 and her home and carers were lovely. Imagine if she was in there now, with Covid raging through? It is so so sad - every country has let down the elderly, some have done it far more but all are negligent. Culling the old. "
2097,2020-05-25,My parents are dead but in 2018 my Mum had dementia and spent the last 4 months of her life in a care home so I can only imagine what it would be like to be imprisoned with Covid-19 every single day. The Govt  and  lockdown supporters are complicit in these crimes.
2098,2020-05-25,When I was stuck in with covid I couldn't send my elderly loved one with dementia away or get any help. He's stronger  and  more aggressive than a child. Social services left medication on the door once  and  they would not come in. I stayed home with pneumonia. #DominicCummngs
2099,2020-05-25,"What endless shite - this man hasn't even apologised! Endless excuses. My dad, 82, diagnosed with dementia, died in the hospital of covid 19. My sister couldn't visit. His friends couldn't visit. I couldn't fly over to visit. He died alone. Resign and arrest #DominicCummngs"
2100,2020-05-25,So for the last 11 weeks I‚Äôve been shielding as a lots of my friends have. I‚Äôve not seen my children or grandkids. My daughter is a nurse and a manager for a dementia care home. They have had no cases of covid-19. they have only just been tested. But lucky neg.
2101,2020-05-25,"Okay, my bad. Maybe I'm a moron too. How can you be exposed to it, or even KNOW you were, yet text negative for COVID-19. (I'm a 70 y/o woman and sometimes don't fully understand. Plus onset of dementia. Sorry if I'm not fact checking. I will CORRECT that going forward. )"
2102,2020-05-25,"The matriarch of my framily had mild dementia and was living in an assisted living apt. w/ her husband. She was forgetful, told rambling stories that were a combo. of past and present but was redirectable. She was confused but still her delightful self. Until COVID..."
2103,2020-05-25,I volunteered myself to be the designated Covid-19 person on my dementia unit at a care home in Barnsley. I sat with people as they died. I held their hand and explained how sorry I was that their families couldn‚Äôt be there with them. I witnessed heartbreak through a window.

2106,2020-05-25,"All I'll say is my Nan had dementia  and  caught covid. Clearly the issue was which was the primary cause of death. It was referred to the Coroner who rang us and discussed it at length  and  really listened. Covid was listed as cause of death, but it felt right and fairly considered."
2107,2020-05-25,My granddad who is 88 and has dementia survived COVID-19 and pneumonia with the help of our #NHSheroes in Wales ü•≥ absolute warrior! #diolch üôè
2108,2020-05-25,My elderly grandmother is in a nursing home with dementia. My mother hasn't been able to visit her for the entire lockdown. Granny tested positive and was quite ill with COVID. She also has a progressive dementia and will disimprove. My family still can't go to see her. 
2109,2020-05-25,My mum has been in and out of hospital in London with her dementia. Her large family cannot see her. She got covid from hospital and is now in a care home. No one can visit they asked for shower gel of all things. Good news is the covid has gone and she will go home this week
2110,2020-05-25,O Colin I feel so sad for you missing your children for so long. It is not easy looking after mums at this strange time. I have been in daily lockdown with my mum for three months too. She is 90 and suffering with bad dementia. She can‚Äôt get what COVID is üòí
2111,2020-05-25,"my nana has dementia and lives in a home that had at least one covid-19 case. her daughter, my grandma, is shielded because she‚Äôs in remission from cancer. we can‚Äôt go to look after either of them, 70 miles away. i will never, ever forgive this government for what they have done."
2112,2020-05-25,"My Uncle died prematurely after heart problems, in care, having caught Covid-19. He was 90. His wife, with dementia, also in care, recovered. Lockdown should end now in my view as I believe millions caught it in January through to March  and  fully recovered weeks ago."
2113,2020-05-25,My Nan is 95 and has dementia. She has been terrified and lonely and due to the removal of her sheltered housing warden. We have played by the rules and I leave her shopping outside. At the minute I am unwell (not Covid) and I am a single mom. We cope. We always have!
2114,2020-05-25,My mum has dementia and is in a care home in Maghull Liverpool. On may 12 she had a test for covid 19 we still waiting on the results the GP has refused to go into the home to examine her until the tests are back despite requests from the home this is scandalous
2115,2020-05-25,"My mother, who has advanced dementia, had to deal with contracting COVID on her own in a care home, with no familiar faces to comfort her. But Dominic Cummings can do what he likes? Explain this."

2117,2020-05-25,Last week I held the hands of patients who lost their entire families. They all had to watch funerals on an iPad. My sister is alone 2 hours away with dementia. I couldn‚Äôt see my daughter when she was ill with COVID. You are a disgrace.

She ended up having to fend for herself. Wish I travelled down to CARE for her like #Dominiccummins @piersmorgan"
2124,2020-05-24,"I can associate totally. My father in law had dementia, fell in the house and had to go to hospital. He was in there for a month with no visitors. Caught Covid and passed away with no family by his side. Then you get this guy flouting lockdown. Never voted Tory and never will."
2125,2020-05-24,"Sadly my neighbor lost her beloved sister to Covid in a care home! What is so sad is that even with dementia she was so happy there üò™ we need to care and look after our aging population, they gave and give us our future üíï"

2133,2020-05-24,"My Mum had dementia and was 91 when she died recently. Covid-19 was noted on her death certificate. I couldn‚Äôt be there to say goodbye or attend her funeral. The government is soulless, heartless and without any shred of honour."
2134,2020-05-24,"One more thing. When I registered my mam's death Covid wasn't reported as the cause of death. She hadn't been seen by the GP who put down the last thing she'd been diagnosed with, dementia. There are thousands more dead than you are told each day."

2145,2020-05-24,"My mother would be 100 today, had she lived. She passed in Jan 2019. I am glad she was not here for COVID-19. She got old age dementia. I had to put her in a nursing home when she get so she could not walk. I am so sorry for those with loved ones in nursing homes they can't visit"

2153,2020-05-23,"Cummings can go to hell. My mum is 94. She has dementia and is recovering from Covid-19. I would love to be by her side, but I have been observing Lockdown rules. My hatred for this hypocritical weasel and this vile government has just tipped the scale."

2218,2020-05-19,"So my 91yr old Nan has made it back to the nursing home from hospital after getting Covid-19. No idea how, very frail  and  dementia ridden. NHS seem to have done a great job!! Thank you"
2219,2020-05-19,"My father in law, with dementia from a stroke, only remembers about the lockdown about 10% of the time, and thinks we're imprisoning him. He only remembers he's a widower MOST of the time. His wife was likely an early COVID case, dying 2 weeks before New York State locked down."
2220,2020-05-19,Today my aunt with advanced dementia tested positive for COVID; staying upbeat is difficult. Things I am grateful for: - Ward matron informing me that the free hand sanitiser looks like lube (IT DOES!) - free hand sanitiser - dog walks -dogs -work projects

2222,2020-05-19,"From personal experience, if I was in a carehome I would prefer to meet my maker by enduring 3-4 weeks of hell by covid-19 than 3 years of trauma and then at the end 3-4 weeks of hell by #dementia."

2236,2020-05-19,"She had Huntington‚Äôs which causes heart and respiratory issues, but it was a private care home, why is it the Gov fault, private care homes is a billions a year profits industry, my dad died of Covid on the 14 Apr in care for dementia, I do not blame the CH."

2238,2020-05-19,I‚Äôm also terrified of seeing people because my grandpa has dementia and we have to go help him and I don‚Äôt think I could ever forgive myself if I gave him or my grandma covid. I can‚Äôt handle that thought
2239,2020-05-19,"The hospital's send patients into care homes even when positive , especially dementia patients , my son's ward had 2 sent to them , the inevitable happened as they don't understand social distancing , up until that point was covid free , sad state of affairs ."
2240,2020-05-18,"Same here. Spoke to my mum's home last week (she has alzheimer's and vascular dementia). They locked down at the end of Feb. Not a single case of Covid - staff or patients. All the PPE they need. Upbeat, positive and in mum's carer's words ""we're all in a happy little bubble""."

2244,2020-05-18,My wife's Mum is 89 & has Dementia/ Alzheimers. She was moved opposite us 11 yrs ago as she deteriorated  and  she is her part time career.

2249,2020-05-18,"My mother-in-law is in a dementia home. 14 residents have died of Covid-19. Absolute rubbish to say the care sector was protected. Think this will in the final analysis, prove to be the biggest scandal."
2250,2020-05-18,"unrelated note, my house is directly across from an assisted living/retirement home. They also have care for dementia patients. So far they haven't had a case of covid and are VERY careful of their people. If/when it gets to the point you can't care for her yourself, there are"
2251,2020-05-18,"REALLY needing some positivity - got word yesterday that my one resident went to ER and tested pos for COVID; has dementia..and is a wrestling match just to get his brief changed. Kind of despairing here, as I did everything right. Didn't matter."
2252,2020-05-18,I've just had to ring my dad to let him know that the manager of my mum's care home (she has dementia so is massively at risk) has rang me to let me know that 8 of their residents has covid 19. That's a phone call I won't forget in a hurry
2253,2020-05-18,"My husband died in January after a pretty awful last couple years in his dementia journey. I know how hard the caregiving is in normal circumstances, can‚Äôt imagine doing it with Covid restrictions. Bless you‚ù§Ô∏è."
2254,2020-05-18,"Similar issue with my father who passed away in his care home on 25/04/20. We hadn‚Äôt visited him for 7-8 weeks. After a week of uncertainty, GP rang saying he believed it was Covid, but refused to record death as Covid, recorded as dementia instead! Not true figures in care homes"
2255,2020-05-18,Collilngswood to date taking new admissions while they can't handle their COVID infested facilty. One nurse completely alone on 11 pm shift for entire 25 person left dementia unit-most with COVID. She was hostile when I requested help that my mom was in pain and didn't see walker
2256,2020-05-18,I'm so sorry for your loss. Grateful your mom didn't have to endure Covid. ‚ù§ My mother has dementia so doesn't know the danger surrounding us. She's spoiled and loved and oblivious.
2257,2020-05-17,"The woman who cares for my mother with dementia was supposed to return home to the Philippines for the first time in 5 years, then COVID hit. My travel inconveniences are petty in comparison."
2258,2020-05-17,"My 89 yr old Mother died last month after testing positive for Covid. It did say that on the death certificate, followed by Parkinson‚Äôs  and  dementia. I don‚Äôt think doctors have been told not to record it  and  I doubt they would deliberately lie anyway. Have you queried it?"
2259,2020-05-17,"Not at all. Lost my auntie to Covid-19 on 4/5. She was almost 82, had late stage dementia  and  lived in a home. Her ‚Äúappointed person‚Äù was my mum, who is 85  and  now has dementia. I suffer with long term MH problems  and  I‚Äôm struggling with it all right now. You ok?"
2260,2020-05-17,"In these past 6 months, I've buried my mom, after a slow decline from dementia, had one friend die of Covid, with his father dying the week after. I know at least 5 others battling it as I type this. Another friend was murdered this week. I've watched my income dwindle to zero."

2263,2020-05-17,My mum is in a dementia unit. When full they have 28. 12 have already died of COVID-19. 5 have it. None have yet to recover. This is not unusual. Government has ignored care homes. I hold them fully responsible for this mess.
2264,2020-05-17,Like if i had dementia or some other issue that deprived me of my dignity and independence and was in a care home i would literally be praying covid takes me so i don‚Äôt have to suffer any longer
2265,2020-05-17,"Yes. My aunt died of dementia and old age in a care home. She was nearly 98 years old. Her death certificate was signed by a doctor who did not visit the care home and had never examined my aunt, alive or dead. Cause of death: ‚ÄúFrailty, Covid-19 and Dementia‚Äù. She was counted."
2266,2020-05-17,"Does anyone have any recommendations for resources for supporting people with dementia or Alzheimer‚Äôs with covid, lockdown etc. My mother in law is really struggling.

2267,2020-05-17,"My uncle was 96 and suffering from dementia. He died in a care home three weeks ago. The death certificate says ""possible Covid-19"" (he was never tested). One of thousands of precious elderly victims of this disease betrayed by the inaction of a cynical and incompetent government"
2268,2020-05-17,Spoke to my nan an she told me the care home where her sister is for dementia has been hit by this Covid-19 fingers crossed it doesn't affect her or anyone else in there
2269,2020-05-17,"Wow 0.058%. Clearly worth every country putting back its economy 10 years and destroying any chance of delivering a greener environment - the excuse will be we cannot afford it! If only we spent 5% of what COVID has cost on preventng cancer, dementia, depression etc etc."
2270,2020-05-17,"Things to do in lockdown, made my Dad a birthday card to send to his care home. He has Covid, Parkinson's and dementia, but this should make him smile. ‚ù£Ô∏è "
2271,2020-05-17,My dads still in hospital due to his care home refusing him to go back! Deny he got the virus whilst staying at the home ü§î Drs have confirmed from day 1 it was covid.Our dad is not just a resident paying a fortune to stay. not just a bed number Our dad is 75 with dementia üò¢
2272,2020-05-17,"Wow, I must be in a nonBBC parallel universe, what with being under house arrest and all, and thinking this is the shittiest year ever, what with not having a proper (non covid) funeral for my mum, and not being able to see my dad with dementia."
2273,2020-05-17,"Read of the day, h/t @sommervilletv, about Scottish care homes and dementia sufferers amidst the Covid-19 crisis. Can you visit your üíû one? ""[S]triking a balance between competing rights is complicated."" How to proceed? ""[T]here are no easy answers [...]"" Oh my. üòû "
2274,2020-05-17,Such a difficult topic. My father-in-law has dementia and thinks COVID-19 is a conspiracy to stop him going out. He keeps asking why we don't visit. I don't have the answers to the dilemma. I don't think either the Scottish or UK government does.
2275,2020-05-17,"But how many of those died because of covid not with it. My mother in law died recently. Dementia, pneumonia and covid are on her death certificate. Yet she has been ill for years. Yet she is down as a covid death."
2276,2020-05-17,This is my long-read on the plight of elderly dementia sufferers who cannot receive care home visits because of Covid-19. It asks if we are placing enough emphasis on quality of life. 
2277,2020-05-17,"I lost my mum to covid and dementia a couple of weeks ago, it really helped me get through some difficult emotions."
2278,2020-05-17,"Yes it is awkward for us to... If I didn't risk my life every day to go to work and care for our 30 elderly dementia family members,, who'd look after them, they would die, regardless of contracting covid 19. It's a job I have to do, I don't need to still be clapped for it now,"
2279,2020-05-17,"Hi Jo. My mum is in a care home right now with dementia. I don't know how long she has left but what do know is that Covid will likely shorten any time we have left with her. Oh, and go fuck yourself and your comment."
2280,2020-05-17,"My Dad, 91, passed away in a nursing care center on 4/11, not from covid-19, he had CHF and dementia. I had been sitting with him every day. He felt abandoned once we were not allowed to visit him, he gave up. He died with no family with him, this has been heartbreaking."
2281,2020-05-17,My step dad passed away today from Covid 19. He was a very good man. He took great care of her through the years. The last two have been especially bad as her dementia has worsened. Prayers up for Ernie. Please take this seriously.
2282,2020-05-16,My mom has dementia and is in a nursing home. Thankfully no Covid so far. We face time and she cries. And I cry. She can‚Äôt understand why I can‚Äôt come there. It sucks.
2283,2020-05-16,"So jacked up today, in a jumble of emotions. Lost my fave aunt/2nd mum to complications of Covid-19 today. She also had early onset dementia and was in nursing home. One of my hs buddies died a couple weeks ago from virus also, he had MS."
2284,2020-05-16,My dementia ridden Dad living in a nursing home just died after most likely catching COVID-19 and dying. This is so fucking offensive! I hate Jeffree Star and he already has me blocked on Twitter. üò§üò†üò°ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨

2286,2020-05-16,To provide a little ray of positivity..my dad (an ex tranmere player) now sadly suffering from dementia tested positive for Covid at his care home last Friday after 3 weeks of illness. He's now coming out the other side at the age of 73 üí™‚ù§üëç
2287,2020-05-16,"My God, I was a puddle. Just brilliant. @rickygervais is sublime. We just lost my father in law (who had dementia) to COVID-19. This cut to the bone, but it was cathartic."
2288,2020-05-16,"My father was 74 and had been suffering with dementia for a number of years when he passed from COVID-19. He had a right to life and he was not on his ""last leg"" and he deserved to spend the last days of his life surrounded by family, not strangers covered head to toe in PPE."
2289,2020-05-16,"It is my understanding 95% of covid deaths involve 2/+life limiting underlying health conditions. Obesity, type2 diabetes , dementia are top of the list. As such, it would appear nationality, gender, ethnicity comparison appear pointless other than for the 5%."
2290,2020-05-16,"#lastnormalphoto Not quite a 'normal' photo, but the last time I saw my mother in her nursing home on Mothering Sunday. I knew it would be the last time I saw her; she died a month later of ""suspected Covid-19 infection""  and  dementia. "
2291,2020-05-16,PLEASE HELP! WHY ARE YOU ALLOWING CA DEPT OF HEALTH & ALAMEDA COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH JEOPARDIZE HAYWARD CONVALESCENT LONGTERM RESIDENTS W/COVID-19 NON-RESIDENCE ü§î THEY'RE MOVING LONGTERM VULNERABLE PATIENTS FROM THEIR ROOMS FOR THESE PATIENTS. MY DAD'S NOT MOBILE WITH DEMENTIA üò§ 
2292,2020-05-16,"Agree,lies. My dad was in a care home that was on its knees because lockdown was NOT done before the country was. He isn‚Äôt there now. He died last Friday of COVID-19. He was 91 with dementia. You might remember him @cononeilluk , he owned Roberto‚Äôs in Wigan."
2293,2020-05-16,"I understand, but can't agree. I lost my mom to COVID-19 on 1 May. She didn't wear a mask in her seniors apartment building, she had dementia  and  didn't understand. So it leads me to believe he's either ignorant, or has dementia. Given his actions, either one seems possible!"
2294,2020-05-16,"My Grandad also has come down with suspected Covid in the last day or so. He's in an end of life unit with dementia and terminal cancer so there's absolutely no way he's getting out of it alive. So angry. So, so angry that they aren't being protected"
2295,2020-05-16,Same thing happened with my wife's uncle. Serious dementia but Covid on the Death Certificate. It makes you think!!
2296,2020-05-16,My brothers father in-law ended up in the hospital again for the third time for Pneomonia for the 3rd time this year. He has dementia and this time they took him to a COVID=19 hospital in Salem OR without the immediate family approval. Just took him and now he‚Äôs isolated.
2297,2020-05-16,"For those just joining. My grandmother was admitted to hospital on 4/3 and immediately put on ventilator for breathing support. She was COVID positive. She‚Äôs 80 and had risk factors (early onset dementia, high blood pressure and allergies). She fought and now is recovering!"
2298,2020-05-15,i recently found out that my 92y/o grandma with severe dementia has to be tested for covid bc someone in her assisted living building tested positive and all i have to say is fuck everyone that is still calling this a hoax
2299,2020-05-15,"My 85 year-old mom is in assisted living, dementia, enclosed in her room for almost 3 months. Covid is spreading thru, people are dying. For Mother's Day, we FaceTimed. I bought a crown (for my Queen)  and  dyed my hair purple. My shocked mom couldn't stop laughing. Pure music."
2300,2020-05-15,Oh my goodnessI just realized who she was I remember her from when I took care of Pat. Oh god love her. She was struggling very hard with dementia before the covid even hit us. Oh I'm so sorry. But she is at peace. Your aunt and uncle were purely tortured by dementia.
2301,2020-05-15,"My Grampa has dementia and was recently hospitalized. My Gramma hasn‚Äôt been able to visit him because of COVID-19. Thanks to his amazing healthcare workers, she was able to FaceTime him today and the first thing he said was ‚ÄúRuthie! You‚Äôre still alive!‚Äù ü•∫"
2302,2020-05-15,"My brother just informed me my elderly, blind, autistic uncle (who is developing dementia) has Covid. As if I already didn‚Äôt hate the care home he is in with the shit they do they allow this to happen. I can‚Äôt even begin to comprehend my anger toward these people right now."
2303,2020-05-15,Tell that to my 94 year old relative who picked up covid from a dementia patient with it who apparently is supposed to be isolated in a care home. Have gov ministers ever been to a care home ? 
2304,2020-05-15,"I wonder the same thing about my mother. She's 90, in a nursing home with severe dementia among other things and tested positive for covid-19. We'll wait and see."
2305,2020-05-15,"'yeah, my mom is deteriorating from a horrid dementia and doesn't even know she has a 2nd grand kid and I can't go near her possibly ever again in her life due to covid so yes it's upsetting you can't have an adult conversation with your mom about something that's bothering you"""
2306,2020-05-15,"It's my 2 girls who will need all my hugs, it was their mums grandparents. It's a strangely beautiful story that he waited until she was ready to move on before slipping away. He had dementia and Covid, she passed away from heart failure and he is with her now."
2307,2020-05-15,Thank you James. It's my sister in law's grandparents so that's my link. It's a weirdly comforting story that given what he went through dementia and Covid that it's almost like he waited for her to be ready to move on.
2308,2020-05-15,Today my nieces lost their great grandfather from my in-laws side. 5 weeks ago he recovered from Covid-19. Dementia separated him  and  his wife 5 years ago. 2 weeks ago his wife went to sleep. In some ways he must have known that bond was broken and went to be with her. üíî
2309,2020-05-15,Similar story -- my 93 yo mother died last month (on hospice care w/dementia for years) except we managed to get her cremated before the nursing home could give her the covid-19 test which they wanted to do. I do not want future generations to be reminded of this terrible scam!

2313,2020-05-15,"What a week! Single Handedly covering entire hospital as both my slt colleagues have covid-19! I managed a videofluoroscopy, set up aphasia therapy on an iPad, support in making CHOICES about e+d for QOL and swallow assess. from covid recovery, #spine, stroke, dementia. Tfi fri!"
2314,2020-05-15,It was not my mothers hand I held it was my youngest sisters. She died from early onset dementia on April 5. She was 60 yrs old. Death in the time of Covid 19 just makes it harder.
2315,2020-05-15,"Rate of death due to Alzheimer's / Dementia is considerably up in April 2020, in care homes. That's interesting. Is Covid linked to mental disorders, or are deaths of Dementia sufferers hastened by Covid being recorded only as Dementia? My money is on the latter. #C4News"
2316,2020-05-15,moving in with my grandma who has dementia (i‚Äôm most likely not continuing school due to covid and circumstances with my program üòí) and bc my 30 year old sister had to move in with my parents bc she broke up with her fianc√©e she‚Äôs in my old room currently killin it in my family
2317,2020-05-15,My Nan was in a care home for dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs. She contracted a virus 2/3 weeks ago and passed away quite quickly. Wasn‚Äôt tested for Covid. Her death certificate has Alzheimer‚Äôs as the cause.
2318,2020-05-15,It seems some people just do not appreciated when I speak my truth. But social distancing and Covid 19. As woken me up to reality On a separate note I really just love how I was embraced and encouraged by DEEP And the dementia diarist. What a beautiful experience it has been. 
2319,2020-05-15,"Yes my mother is in a nursing home, she has dementia and is 96, they locked down before we did. No COVID."
2320,2020-05-15,"üôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè My MIL who has dementia is in long term care where there have been cases of COVID. These are crazy, scary times. I feel your anger and sadness."
2321,2020-05-15,"Jennifer, I am so, so sorry. The combo of covid and dementia is especially cruel. My heart goes out to you. Love from NC."
2322,2020-05-15,"Thanks Nick, my father's GP told me the cremation form stating ""suspects #COVID19"" is what epidemiologists will count? Death certificate states #dementia  and  other co-morbidities, but not #Covid as untested (6 April when PHE refused to test corpses). Common tale? #excessdeaths"
2323,2020-05-15,I swear the lack of information we are receiving from the Mater hospital regarding my 84 year old dad who has COVID but suffers with cognitive dementia is an absolute disgrace something needs to be put in place for families we have been very patient till now @SimonHarrisTD
2324,2020-05-15,"This is media construed bullsh*t. Lies. I live in CT, 15 minutes from NY border, I have seen no dead bodies. I know one person out of my HUGE list of friends, family and acquaintances, who had pneumonia, COPD, and dementia for 2 years, and was in hospice, who died from ""COVID""."
2325,2020-05-15,Managers can refuse to admit as I have done in the past. My dad is living in a dementia care home. They shut doors to visitors early on. Covid free so far. They didn't wait 4 govt. They do hold some responsibility
2326,2020-05-15,"Might there be some link to many having DNAR on their üò∑ records, esp those with dementia /alzheimers? Not Covid related but my dad died in 2016 in care home, without DNAR he probably would have gone to hospital and died there."
2327,2020-05-15,"Another LIE! @mrjamesob @LBC 12,000 have not died in care homes after being ""tested"" for COVID-19. Doctors can put COVID-19 on a death certificate with no test. If my dying mother loses her battle due to the current situation, it will still be the dementia that kills her."
2328,2020-05-15,My ‚Äúspoiled young remainer ‚Äú is at this moment working in a dementia ward with 15 Covid patients üò¢
2329,2020-05-15,"Agnes William's, my wife's mum passed away peacefully in her dementia care home last night, sadly taken from us in the end by the covid virus. We have nothing but praise for the staff in their wonderful care for Agnes over the last year."
2330,2020-05-15,"I wasn't talking about Covid-19 dummy, I was talking about dementia. Keep up"
2331,2020-05-15,"Collingswood Nursing and Rehab-Rockville COVID surged to 91 residents; 23 dead; 29 staff, 1 dead; 21 are in dementia unit; my mom w dementia neglected; staff untested(except own); urged to return too soon, jobs threatened; agency subs and return staff must retest."
2332,2020-05-15,"My mum is in a care home , they locked down well before govt lockdown .. they‚Äôve always had plenty of PPE and are testing and are COVID free although mum is receiving end of life care she has advanced dementia so sad for us as we can‚Äôt be with her"
2333,2020-05-15,"Well, it was bound to happen. COVID-19 has made its way to my grandmother‚Äôs nursing home. And so, 3000 miles away, I have to sit with this. If I call her, her dementia will not let her recognize me, but she is already feeling lost and abandoned. And I can‚Äôt fix any of this."
2334,2020-05-15,I‚Äôve been crying the last two days after finding out my mom was rushed to the hospital. I can‚Äôt go see her because the COVID policies and because she has dementia I can‚Äôt talk to her. I used to talk to my mom every day and we were close.
2335,2020-05-15,It‚Äôs hard having someone who suffers from dementia deal with everything COVID. My grandpa now thinks he has Corona because he has a head cold  and  keeps saying his time is going to end  and  I justü•∫üíî
2336,2020-05-15,My wife is a thin white woman (ok she's Latina but it's not necessarily obvious) and she gets treated like this. A lot of doctors just hate women. But please tell me you're OK. Isn't low oxygen without breathlessness a COVID critical sign?
2337,2020-05-15,I left the Covid unit at my job last week Thursday. There were 24 Patients. Now exactly a week later there‚Äôs 36 and 33 of them are new. Covid in nursing homes spreads like fire. Especially when they are dementia patients. They touch everything and it‚Äôs hard to isolate them.
2338,2020-05-14,"My mom died 29 April...covid, 10 years in a CLSC, dementia Parkinson, a vegetable, 10 years, it reeked like shit on that floor.... government ran, cows have better life than she had!!!!"
2339,2020-05-14,I am so sorry to hear that. I lost my dad on the 1st April from covid-19 then my mum on the 5th April from vascular dementia but I'm sure it was covid-19 as my dad would of been with her the week before. I'm so sorry for ur loss lets all remember the good times with our parentsx
2340,2020-05-14,My great uncle has dementia and is now in hospital fighting covid-19. So tonight we #clappedforcarers  and  quizzed to raise funds for vital dementia research. Thank you to everyone who is helping on the front line but also to those helping charities survive during this tough time.‚ù§Ô∏è 
2341,2020-05-14,"not many here too but those that did made up for it, couldnt help but get the tears especially after facebook chat with my sister yesterday she works in end of life dementia unit , 22 dead , 16 covid positive, poorly run home, she has been tested after a worry but she seems ok"
2342,2020-05-14,Wondering how I‚Äôm going to see my grandma I‚Äôm kind of scared she had a stroke and recently recovered from covid-19 she also has dementia so idk how she is going to be if I see her.
2343,2020-05-14,My mom is in a nursing home with dementia and I haven't seen her since the beginning of March until today. A nurse connected us through messenger. The facility has a pretty bad covid outbreak. I miss my mom and I'm scared for her.
2344,2020-05-14,A few moments before I went outside to #clapforcarers my Mum rang to tell me that a family member in a care home has Covid-19. She has dementia and her family can't go and see her. The care staff are looking after her and passing messages to her. I really hope this ends soon!
2345,2020-05-14,My 91 year old father in Ontario was just admitted to hospital. Not Covid. He has dementia. Is ‚Äúquite agitated.‚Äù No one can visit. üò¢
2346,2020-05-14,"So..I have today been asked to choose a care home for my Dad to be discharged into, from the covid free dementia ward where he has been for weeks. Covid status of care homes is ""confidential""..to avoid confusion..anyone care to explain that thinking? @MattHancock"
2347,2020-05-14,"I am often thankful my dear stepdad is not here to live through covid. He would have been 90 now, in late stages of dementia, most likely in care. Would have been hell on earth not being able to see him. We would have been worried sick about him."
2348,2020-05-14,"My Mum is in a care home and I am just waiting for that phone call to say she has Covid 19, and as she is in the final stages of Dementia she will not survive it."
2349,2020-05-14,As if my grandma beat COVID only to leave this world a few weeks later. Dementia really ain‚Äôt shit.
2350,2020-05-14,Oh so sweet! Heartbreaking! But do sweet. My mom had dementia too. It‚Äôs difficult enough without social distancing and the fear of COVID. Be safe and best wishes to you my friend.
2351,2020-05-14,Many Oklahomans may not be suffering from hopelessness and depression if after almost two months of waiting on unemployment they got paid. I have a 67 year old mother out of work due to COVID and caring for my father with dementia. Do better STITT and OESC!
2352,2020-05-14,"Well,90% of deaths underlying, diabetes,lung,and Dementia!.No wonder care homes particularly susceptible,my own aunt died in a home last week,she has had dementia for a long time,she also had COVID 19 on the death certificate,as did 8 others who died there."
2353,2020-05-14,"It seems simple to me. Dementia as primary cause of death is to my mind disingenuous; yes it increases vulnerability to many acute and chronic illnesses but as a principal cause of death, no. What is obvious is a desire by both government and care homes to disguise Covid deaths."
2354,2020-05-14,14 died of Covid-19 in my mother-in-law‚Äôs dementia home.
2355,2020-05-14,"I‚Äôm a nurse with COVID, probably from reusing dirty N95s and working with dementia patients who simply could not grasp the need to wear a mask and social distance. I worked so hard to try not to get COVID. But I got it. I feel lucky to have my twitter friends and my cats."
2356,2020-05-14,"I am a senior citizen (so, at risk) and a sole caretaker of a parent in nursing home with dementia. I cannot afford 2 take ANY chance at all, for 1 day, I may get that call that I can enter that NH  and  hug my parent again. I'd like to know I did everything I could to be covid free"
2357,2020-05-14,"my gran susan has dementia and has recently been diagnosed with covid-19, and the home shes in put up this photo of her with her baby doll which she has named roberto üò≠üò≠ and she treats him like a real baby! just feel like everyone deserves to see this photo n smile üíó "
2358,2020-05-14,"My wife's Uncle recently passed, riddled with dementia ‚Äì in a care home, DNR in place, only a matter of time. Registered cause of death of...COVID ‚Äì starting to think there‚Äôs a narrative being played out here."
2359,2020-05-14,"My mum is the ward manager of a Covid ward n I‚Äôm so proud, but I‚Äôm always proud of her. She normally cares for patients with dementia etc n I love it when she comes home n talks about her day. Much more interesting than mine ‚ù§Ô∏è"
2360,2020-05-14,My dad. Haven‚Äôt seen him since February. He has late stage dementia and in a care unit where they JUST told us COVID is on. BTW Dad loved Jerry Stiller and Ann Meara 
2361,2020-05-14,MY ELDERLY FRIENDS WIFE HAS JUST DIED. SHE HAD LATE STAGE DEMENTIA. HE WAS DEVOTED TO HER. CARED FOR HER RATHER THAN AN HOSPICE. THEN SHE HAD TO BE ADMITTED. HE WAS BY HER SIDE. THEN HE WAS BANNED FROM SEEING HER. SHE DIED 10 DAYS LATER. COVID ON HER DEATH CERTIFICATE. PURE EVIL 
2362,2020-05-14,Good morning Piers. My mother is in a home with severe mixed dementia. Not one case √≤f covid 19.....and test equipment for every resident and carer..can we stop we stop this negativity and as an experienced journalist let's have fair balance in reporting some positivity
2363,2020-05-14,"I will donate my daughters mother in law works on the covid wards and i really feel for her,daughter works with vulnerable young adults, and son works with people with dementia and mental health issues so I know the struggles they have had working at this time #proudmum"
2364,2020-05-14,This covid+ pt with dementia just pulled the shit out of my hair while I was doing an IV on her. Grabbed the fuck out of my bun lol. Swear I came out that room looking like I got my ass beat.
2365,2020-05-14,Just found out the new covid-19 hot spot in my state is a block away at a dementia Alzheimer‚Äôs care facility 41 staff and patients tested positive so far üôèüèºüò™üôèüèº 
2366,2020-05-14,I cried many tears today - happy & sad ones. We were able to see my #dementia mom during a car parade. These COVID times are hard on #dementia families. 
2367,2020-05-13,Well I just got a phone call and one of my dear friends mother has COVID-19 . She‚Äôs in an Assisted living with dementia and caught itüò•üåàüòûüíîüëÑ
2368,2020-05-13,"Lol fr my cousin (who is 51) went OFF on me because I shared COVID-19 memes on fb after my gma passed away, my gma was 98 and had dementia. "
2369,2020-05-13,Perhaps it is easier to isolate in a care home and not so distressing for the person. I know my Dad (93 with dementia) would prefer to be isolated than on a covid frontline.
2370,2020-05-13,"My aunt died 5 days ago, had been in a care home for 4 yrs with dementia tested positive for covid Went to hospital, a few days before she died. But if she hadn‚Äôt of got covid she wouldn‚Äôt of died.. a miserable exsistence, yes , but a life none the less. X"
2371,2020-05-13,"You have to be firm but kind and think of them as 5 year olds that don't know any better. Both my parents had dementia and I was their caregiver, I'm well versed in the firm but kind conversation. It's effing HARD but losing them to COVID-19 would be worse."
2372,2020-05-13,"Before Covid we were 5 minutes away from putting my 80-year-old mom with dementia into Grand Villa. So thankful she‚Äôs safe and only seeing her caregiver, my sister. "
2373,2020-05-13,Not covid related. I applied for the tax back from ppi payout on behalf of my mum who has dementia. It appears she's shredded the letters. How do I inform hmrc and can it be reapplied for?
2374,2020-05-13,My cousin just told me her mom won't let her hex the nursing home people who let our uncle with dementia and brain cancer be exposed to Covid inside the nursing home ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
2375,2020-05-13,"Thanks for your well wishes. I've remained confined to my house, except to attend the recent graveside funeral of my aunt who suffered from severe dementia and was in palliative care at a downtown hospital. She tested positive for COVID-19 prior to her death."
2376,2020-05-13,Laura go and work in a care home for a month. You will learn something. My mother is 96 in nursing home has had dementia for 16 years. There is no COVID 19 in the home they locked down before we did. I have not seen her for 8 weeks. I do not need your drama about care homes.
2377,2020-05-13,My great nan suffered from dementia for many years and she was sadly taken away from us this week from this horrible disease and covid 19. Please raise dementia awareness with @DementiaUK by donating on this @JustGiving page if you can. Thank you
2378,2020-05-13,"I know. My mum, with dementia, discharged into care of my father, Covid positive, on the 22 April. It is on the discharge document. Both in their 80s."
2379,2020-05-13,"It will be virtually impossible to maintain social distancing with dementia sufferers. In my mums care home, those most severely affected by dementia wander around going in and out of other residents rooms,touching and sometimes removing items. It‚Äôs no wonder they contract COVID."
2380,2020-05-13,Unbelievable. My Cousin died of COVID (95 with Dementia) in a nursing home and his son just said to me on the phone that its all a racket and he didnt die of COVID but they get paid more to say he did.
2381,2020-05-13,Not all care homes have dementia patients. My cousin died in a care home. Not a single dementia patient was in there. Most were severe stroke sufferers with additional health conditions. The home took in 10 Covid patients. We can‚Äôt keep using dementia as the excuse.
2382,2020-05-13,My wife who is a night supervisor in a care for dementia patients is recovering slowly from a very difficult battle with covid19 her home received the visors yet when she requested them from the home manager she was refused a week later she tested positive for covid.
2383,2020-05-13,"Have you got dementia? You were just talking about a second wave of Covid, now you‚Äôre encouraging folks to go on holiday. Get a grip @theJeremyVine"

2386,2020-05-13,"One down, 9 to go üòÖ for the dears in the care home my aunt works at. They have varying degrees of dementia and the bears are to help them cope with all the covid worry. I hope it helps ü•∫ "
2387,2020-05-13,"My mum is in a care home with vascular dementia (covid free at the moment) so her property is empty and I need to sell it so I am able to continue to pay for her care now her savings are all gone. This, for me, is welcome news."
2388,2020-05-13,"My elderly Aunt , 89 years of age, with dementia recovered from Covid -19 in her care home. She was tested and her care has been amazing. @GMBDaily"
2389,2020-05-13,Morning Liam. Sad day today for me as my dear Aunty who had Dementia/COVID-19 is getting buried today. You have a good day anyway x
2390,2020-05-13,My lovely Auntie is getting buried today. She had been moved from hospital into a Nursing Home and passed away 4wks later..cause of death Dementia and COVID-19 but not tested x
2391,2020-05-13,"There has been a serious crisis in LTC long before covid. The process to get a loved one, including my mom who had dementia, even on a list is a nightmare for the loved one and the families. Ridiculous. Sadly my mom died in hospital Feb 24/20 waiting for a LTC home."
2392,2020-05-13,My brother. He is in a veterans nursing facility with dementia. Two months since I have been able to see him. 30 veterans have died from Covid at his facility as of today. I miss him. 
2393,2020-05-12,Im not allowed to see my mam as i am blind and have a guidedog and also she is in stage 7 dementia so what do i do??? I want to remember my mam as my mam not as i see her now üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢ this is so hard for to write as my mam doesnt know me and how far ive come #ilovemymam #covid
2394,2020-05-12,"Hi @somegoodnews! Love the show! My elderly uncle Gerry survived Coronavirus! He is recovering at his home in Maine! Unfortunately, he has some early signs of dementia, but we are just so happy that he survived COVID."

2396,2020-05-12,"my 88 yo grandad is in a memory care facility in missouri where he lives with dementia 10 days ago he tested positive for COVID and was admitted to hospital he's miraculously recovered, and is back in his room where he told me he's happily expecting a new baby soon ü§ó"
2397,2020-05-12,"I'm not really sure which is worse for my mom, dying of Covid-19 or losing even more to her battle with dementia from the isolation? I'm very concerned she will not get the ground she is losing back. She's under hospice care for dementia, her time is limited."
2398,2020-05-12,"Last week I lost my last living grandparent to dementia, who was in a care home rife with Covid-19. Now my car's got gearbox problems the week before I was going to be one of the five or six permitted mourners. Warrantied but there's nowhere open to honour that. Enjoy your conga."
2399,2020-05-12,Another horrifying day. We are in isolation with my beloved 93 yo Mom. She has descended into terrifying hallucinations and extreme anger because of dementia. We can't get her into nursing care because of a Covid outbreak. Just getting thru each hour
2400,2020-05-12,"I've just got to blow a gasket really quick. Warning fowl language. Fuck COVID, Fuck this quarantine, my 87 year old grandma who has dementia is in the Hospital alone. At this moment they will not let anyone in with her. She also has Lupus."
2401,2020-05-12,I'm sorry but... you cannot isolate dementia residents even if they're Covid positive.. as my daughter is a senior carer and we spoke about this..
2402,2020-05-12,"On #IND2020 it‚Äôs an opportunity to recognise the efforts of those dealing with Covid-19, including nurses from our Dementia Assessment Unit. Julie Megaw, Clinical Manager said: ‚ÄúTo clap a patient out of isolation is one of the highlights of my career  and  a very proud moment.‚Äù "
2403,2020-05-12,Yes agree though I know also of instances where the person has died almost certainly with covid but death certificate says dementia (my aunt for example)
2404,2020-05-12,"This is my daughter, her name is natalie, she is senior nurse in a dementia care home, she is a fantastic carer to all the resident's, she went into this job to care for people, not to be finding them dead in there beds with this covid "
2405,2020-05-12,"Matt Hancock shame on you. Hospitals have categorcally sent people back into care situations. My mother, with dementia, was sent back to my father Covid positive. When I spoke to the hospital (Boston Pilgrim) they were quite blas√© about it. #PiersMorgan #BBCBreakfast"
2406,2020-07-09,My grandad is 80 has dementia and had a bad heart got corona in hosp and was really ill he is now home and doing just fine !! They only tell the bad stories and scare people but you can serve this even at a old age with health issues x
2407,2020-07-09,"Not just to students, but also full grown adults too. The Corona virus pandemic which as thus affected the economy of many households in the world is causing a new wave of schizophrenic disorders e.g schizophrenic psychosis, dementia praecox."
2408,2020-07-04,"Corona affects me too.Haven‚Äôt seen my brother who has dementia in months,my sister is under going chemo for cancer, she lives next to a locked down suburb. Elderly father etc.HOWEVER, this is NEVER an excuse to harm another human being. Their lives are not worth more than another"
2409,2020-07-04,Not my specialty. I'm into fake news. Notice that the number of deaths from corona is tiny in comparison to deaths from corona fear; people with chest pains scared to go to the hospital. People with dementia dying because family was scared to care for them. 
2410,2020-07-02,"I just went to pick up a prescription for my dog and the vet told me both her parents got corona in nursing homes and one was in ICU for two weeks. One has dementia, Dewine you make me sick !!!!"

2414,2020-06-26,I haven't seen my mom since before the Corona virus reached Michigan. We just heard the no visiting orders have extended until (at the earliest) July 4. I wonder how bad her dementia had gotten. How confused she most be. And angry. I miss my mom.
2415,2020-06-22,I was allowed to visit my aunt's care home yesterday for the first time in four months. She has always known who I am before & been so happy to see me. She didn't recognize me for the whole time. It was heartbreaking. Corona is taking away those we love in so many ways #dementia
2416,2020-06-20,"getting ready to take off for the Twin Cities. Dad was put on in home hospice this week. Was given 3 months. Kidney, liver failure and early dementia. Mom's a wreck. Prayers welcome. Good thing is I'll get to see my 2 y/o grandson today! Miss him most since corona."

2421,2020-06-17,It may not mean much to economy freaks or our @VP who my elderly dad w/ dementia wrongly gives credence to‚Äîmy anxiety is high now that my paper shares their Ind  and Assisted Living Home is latest to have Corona outbreak. Wish my parents had called me first. 
2422,2020-06-17,"Hardest thing to hear is my mom trying to explain to my grandmother, who has Alzheimer and dementia, that we can‚Äôt see her because of the corona. My grandmother repeating that she is in jail. Asking where we are."
2423,2020-06-16,"I just want the world to change for the better before I die. 2020 is a shit show. Both my grandmothers are dying (one has advanced dementia) oh and I can't see them since rona and I can't risk it, my dad got corona and almost died. Just want this year to chill tf out"

2437,2020-06-01,Since the start of this corona virus crisis I‚Äôve moved in to care for my mother who has mild onset dementia. I am grateful to be here to care for her and to just spend time with her. It is a part of the aging/life process but still emotionally difficult at times. #Family

2441,2020-05-25,Positive corona thread: 2 weeks ago my Granny was diagnosed and when I found out I was distraught-jumping straight to the conclusion that she would be gone before I even got to hug her one more time. My biggest fear was that she would be in pain with the virus and her dementia

2444,2020-05-24,My point is less time spent doesn't mean zero risk for dementia. It just means less risk for dementia. And I'm not willing to take any risk of dementia on account of the Corona virus.
2445,2020-05-23,#CampingWorld my wife is a nurse. She got sent to get test for corona 19. I missed spending more time with my mother. She is in a dementia an Alzheimer‚Äôs home.i am in the military I do not want to lose my wife. I just want to spend time with her before I can not anymore.

2449,2020-05-19,"So sad. I live 900 miles from my Mom and siblings. Mom had dementia. Mom died in a nursing home (which she was well taken care of) of Corona virus. The nursing home was under lockdown. Mom died alone without my siblings, lockdown."
2450,2020-05-18,"My guess is that he's taking several medications, including possibly dementia meds, and it's easier to tell him one of them is the fancy shiny object corona virus drug as a ""preventative"" because otherwise he won't comply if he knew what they were really for."
2451,2020-05-18,So I got tested for Corona today. It was bloody agony. Back of the throat was ok but up the nose was torture. Anyone calling for that to be done to old people with dementia  and  little kids randomly need to have a rethink. It would be cruel in my opinion. #coronavirus #coronatesting
2452,2020-05-18,"Exactly. Just start jumping up and down. If I told you that in my area just the chance's of you catching Corona with the current stats we have, which include deaths ""with"", are 526/1. You're more likely to die from a Stroke, Cancer  and  dementia combined. That's some context."

2458,2020-05-16,my grandma is in a nursing home & has dementia  and  yesterday i found out she has the corona virus. all i can think about is how scared she probably is  and  it breaks my heart. i just want her to get better so i can go see her.
2459,2020-05-16,"I mostly worry about my parents. My dad has recent been diagnosed with diabetes & my step-mom has onset dementia. Late last year, she climbed a ladder, broke a rib,  and  punctured her lung. She‚Äôs had pneumonia 4 times since. She‚Äôs in her 70s  and  corona could kill her."

2465,2020-05-13,My grandma just beat the corona virus and she doesn‚Äôt speak English and she has dementia. That‚Äôs bad bitch energy. She beat it and didn‚Äôt even know what it was. 100% bad bitch.
2466,2020-05-12,I would probably give half to people I know who need an extra bit of money and the half to two separate charity's one being a Corona virus one and then other being a charity which helps with dementia as my grandmother has it and many other families I know are effected by it
2467,2020-05-10,"Happy Mother's Day to my momma. This pic was 5 years ago, before Dementia took her ability to understand. This Mother's Day I cannot go see her  and  tell her I love her because of Covid  and  this is one time that I am thankful for dementia, as she doesn't know that I am not there "
2468,2020-05-10,My mom doesn‚Äôt know what COVID is. Doesn‚Äôt even know (or understand) there‚Äôs a pandemic. That‚Äôs what decades of hard drinking gets you when you‚Äôre barely 60 - dementia and diapers. #HappyMothersDay
2469,2020-05-10,"Called my mum. Not a great day for her, so she was confused and not well-connected to reality. Dementia sucks, because it means I will lose her twice. My stepfather continues to believe that we are overreacting to covid, so I hope his attitude does not cost me seeing her again."
2470,2020-05-10,"Hi, I‚Äôll be watching. If you can, a question. My father (68) has been battling Parkinson‚Äôs for 9 years & dementia recently. My mum has cared for him until he got taken to hospital with pneumonia. He‚Äôs Now in a nursing home with Covid 19 patients arriving from hospital......"
2471,2020-05-10,"Sorry for your loss. My Mom‚Äôs got Alzheimer‚Äôs, and major Dementia and ironically is in the hospital for fractures from a fall, Pneumonia and Covid-19. I don‚Äôt buy the Covid-19 though."
2472,2020-05-10,Congrats for coming forward. My boss is in law had dementia for the last for years and then got shingles and his organs were shutting down. He has been deteriorating badly then he went to the hospital and passed away and then they said he died of Covid which is wrong
2473,2020-05-10,Also. Figures are partially inflated as some people who are dying of cancer dementia etc are also having covid put on their death certificate because they didn‚Äôt test them so they assume. Though all deaths are bad I won‚Äôt deny that. I‚Äôm thick but I have my limits
2474,2020-05-10,"How true, Donny ~ my mom went to heaven on Thursay after a battle with dimentia and Covid 19. She is irreplaceableüíú"

2476,2020-05-10,"Just wanna clarify that I am not defending EXACTLY what he is saying, because it isn't that extreme, but, my grandmother died due to her body shutting down from her dementia, but she had covid, so they wrote her primary cause of death as covid, and dementia was the secondary. -&gt;"
2477,2020-05-10,"So change it.........your book is so good include it in your pic and bio....I know only 2 with covid, I would loose count as to how many I know who have had or have Alzheimer/Dementia. Took 3 of my class mates as well."
2478,2020-05-10,"Touch matters and is the cornerstone of my relationship with Mom. I was born premature in 82, 1 pound, 15 ounces, over 10 weeks early. Mom‚Äôs touch saved my life. With dementia, I can‚Äôt heal her mind with touch, but I can warm her heart. But, COVID-19 won‚Äôt let me. #endalz"
2479,2020-05-10,"Plagiarizing from my sister ... My Mom just passed away after a long battle w/ dementia  and  a shorter one w/ Covid. I was blessed to have this woman as my mom.

2482,2020-05-10,I would love to surprise my mom. She has major health issues and is looking after my father who‚Äôs newly diagnosed with dementia and wheelchair bound. We were helping til the covid. She sure could use a special surprise. Love you mom
2483,2020-05-10,Yep! My sister in law (who holds 3 degrees inc 2 nursing) has been sending us conspiracy theories regarding covid. I had to send her an article on how to critically appraise info the other day. Thank god she has retired. At one point she gave someone holy water to cure dementiaüò±
2484,2020-05-10,Who's life fuck all deaths from this pandemic my hole majority of deaths in nursing home people dyin from old age heart attacks dementia hit by a bus all been put down as covid death to try and justify lockdown its laughable
2485,2020-05-10,1/3 Just heard that my Great Uncle passed away due to #covid. We weren‚Äôt amazingly close but I have fond memories of being on his boat when I was a kid and having fun. He was 87 and had dementia. He‚Äôd ‚Äòleft‚Äô long ago but was safe in a care home.
2486,2020-05-10,I read this as well. My mum passed around the same time as it was published. Her death certificate listed both dementia and covid. I didn‚Äôt realise (until reading the above tweet) they were listed in any order.
2487,2020-05-10,I lost my dad 7 years ago after a decade long fight with dementia. On his death certificate it states pneumonia for the reason of death. So they can't move the goal posts just for COVID-19.
2488,2020-05-10,Was just thinking. After 4 years of trying to partner with others to set up a community social enterprise Dementia related music venture all to no avail. And now with Covid 19 Maybe I have just been deluding myself Which is another reason why I‚Äôm swimming back to shore.üëç RA
2489,2020-05-10,"My uncle passed away a few hours ago. He didn‚Äôt have Covid. He had dementia. He was in a good nursing home but my aunt, his 3 kids, his 6 grandkids, and 8 great-grandkids couldn‚Äôt visit. My aunt was deprived of the last 2 months with her husband of 62 years. Fuck you, Cruz."
2490,2020-05-10,"As for the elderly? I do care. My grandad is in a home. But I‚Äôm not gonna blame people for going to the park if he dies of Covid-19. He‚Äôs 90, he‚Äôs got dementia. Won‚Äôt mean I won‚Äôt be sad when he dies, for whatever reason."
2491,2020-05-10,My mom past away 2 days ago from Dementia...I pray to God her death certificate does not come back with COVID-19....Because they did treat her for it...Even though 2 tests came back negative...Heads will roll if they do put it on her death certificate!üòè
2492,2020-05-09,"Thanks, @KateSwaffer for drawing my attention to these further insights into the parallels between #dementia and the psychological stresses imposed by #Covid_19"
2493,2020-05-09,I couldn‚Äôt hold my dad‚Äùs hand as he passed away on a COVID ward yesterday @Tim_Burgess He had dementia and would have been frightened. These people doing the bloody conga are surely taking us towards a second wave of this deadly virus.
2494,2020-05-09,This is a good news story. My mom Adele Presutti is 99 years old. She is recovering from covid 19. She is in rehab eating and yes walking again with a walker. I am lucky to have my for so long. She has dementia and doesn't know her family but just to see her smile is all we need.
2495,2020-05-09,"Spent my week doing ultrasounds on Covid patients in RotoProne beds; a rotisserie for intubated humans, in induced comas so that their lungs can heal through relaxation. After 30 days, patients can get ‚ÄúICU Dementia‚Äù, which can last for years. Stay Quarantined! @texasdemocrats"

2498,2020-05-09,"I may have shared this one before, but it needs to be repeated. My own mother is currently in quarantine in a nursing home in Massachusetts because she tested positive for COVID-19. She is a dementia patent. I gave no way to be with her and comfort her. #COVID19 #CoronaVirus"
2499,2020-05-09,My nana worked as a nurse for most of her life. First in the army and then the NHS. She has vascular dementia and is in a nursing home. We are waiting for her results for a Covid 19 test even though her home has been in lockdown. All so these idiots can conga. :(
2500,2020-05-09,"My Uncle died last week, we were expecting it as he had vascular dementia and was sleeping and not eating. We didn‚Äôt realise but he‚Äôd been tested for COVID (shocker).

2505,2020-05-09,"I'm about to visit my mother who has dementia and may be dying from Covid, so you can take your toaster and stick a fork in it."
2506,2020-05-09,I'm so sorry for your pain. My uncle's wife is suffering from dementia and she and all the others in the memory care unit are dying right now -- of loneliness. Not to mention all the other residents. The untold victims of this covid madness. Praying for you and her.
2507,2020-05-09,"My son is a carer working in a dementia unit, and was told to go back to work?! As it turns out they think he did actually have covid, but he didn't go back to work as he was so ill. Imagine if he had... those ppl are so vulnerable. Honestly, they're clueless + dangerous"
2508,2020-05-09,"im probably forgetting something. this lowgrade dementia is a motherfucker. should i come up missing itll be either the covid got me or i called my partner by an ex's name (which is not how i wanna leave this earth, but i understand. it's definitely mutual.)"
2509,2020-05-09,"After stresses of recent days with H & D‚Äôs illness & much toing & froing to JR, etc, woke up to sad news that my uncle died during the night (not COVID), complications of long-term Parkinson‚Äôs, Lewy Body Dementia  and  a recent fall.

2511,2020-05-09,My mother in law died from Covid. She would have been celebrating and remembering. My mother has dementia and is in a care home. She was delighted by yesterday's celebrations. Took her back. A window in her dementia. It isn't all about us!
2512,2020-05-09,So this is cute af...my papa recently fell and had to have an emergency hip replacement and because of COVID 19 my nan (who has severe dementia) could not see him in the hospital...but they found a way to see each other through the window of his rehab facility ‚ù§Ô∏è

2514,2020-05-09,"My 96-year-old gma has dementia. It‚Äôs a horrible disease and Covid-19 has made it especially hard. BUT, my family received an unexpected blessing. She has made a friend in her nursing home and thinks they‚Äôve been bffs her entire life. For once I‚Äôm glad she doesn‚Äôt know reality."
2515,2020-05-08,My dog Mya. She‚Äôs 11 with arthritis & dementia. Her meds cost me around $200 a month. I had to get a 2nd job to afford it but was laid off due to COVID. Not sure how I‚Äôll afford it now tho 
2516,2020-05-08,"I know. There's a resident in my sister's workplace who was discharged from hospital, subsequently came down with Covid, having contracted it in hospital. Hospitals don't want the burden of dementia patients, care homes don't want burden of Covid patients. No one wants them."
2517,2020-05-08,Unless their death was expected it will probably go down as Covid related. A patient with dementia could live for 6 more months. Or a year. Or 5 years. My dad had cancer but after catching shingles died within a day. Cancer didn't kill him - shingles did. Just like Covid kills.
2518,2020-05-08,"My dad isn‚Äôt on a vent, but is bedridden on a COVID floor for over a week with dementia and a new hip with no PT. This hospital stay will kill him."
2519,2020-05-08,"My mother in law died after contracting Covid but that is no reason not to celebrate VE Day. My mother's care home is decked out as if it is 1945 and, given her dementia, she will feel as if she is in VE Day itself."
2520,2020-05-08,"My mum is 88 and has dimentia. Ask her what happened 5 mins ago, not a clue. I've sat here all day and night listening to stories from 80 years ago, like it was yesterday in her mind. When she told me stories of her dad, I was in floods. This covid certainly heightens emotions!!"
2521,2020-05-08,Please look at Derbyshire CC decision to use a covid free dementia home as a place for covid + patients discharged from hospital only a door separating the covid + and dementia residents and using the same staff pool my mum is resident DCC not consulting Please help us fight üôè
2522,2020-05-08,"I do not. I do know that my father in law, who is currently in Hospice because of dementia and cancer, more than likely will pass away in the next two weeks. When he does, his death will be labeled as a COVID death. We‚Äôre in IL."
2523,2020-05-08,"That‚Äôs one of the really selfish elements of it, because you can guarantee that attitude would change when staring death in the face. Saying that, my granny is 95, in a home, with full blown dementia. Quick Covid death clearly not a disaster there."
2524,2020-05-08,Jonathan please can you apply some pressure on Tory Derbyshire CC not to allow a covid FREE dementia home to be used as a step down for civid pos patients in the community or Hospital my mother is resident it‚Äôs being pushed through no consultation @RuthGeorge6 üôè üíî
2525,2020-05-08,"My wonderful kind dad died of COVID-19 today. I wasn‚Äôt holding his hand or even in the ward. He had dementia so would have been frightened, but the amazing @NHSMillion were fighting his corner. As for you @BorisJohnson I hold you completely responsible."
2526,2020-05-08,"My mother, who has COVID-19 and is in a New York nursing home (agh) seemed to benefit from the Hydroxychloroquine they gave her. We cannot see her and she has dementia (so it's hard to call her, which makes it even worse), but they tell us she is on the mend. She's 96."
2527,2020-05-08,Old lady friend of my dad died from dementia and cancer and her cause was also listed as COVID-19 along with my neighbours 94 Yr old dad who died from a chest infection and was tested... Negative... Cert says covid
2528,2020-05-08,"Their bare face lying, my friend's auntie died last week of dementia, they put COVID-19 on her death certificate, she didn't have COVID-19. You can see this Italian leader has had enough. who can blame him? "
2529,2020-05-08,"Good in my house thanks Katey. But my mom who is in an assisted living with dementia and COPD with emphysema, is also fighting bi lateral pneumonia and tested positive for Covid. Good days and bad!! Stay Safe!!"

2532,2020-05-08,Almost all are! The care home my uncle was in 2 guys died of vascular dementia but Covid was blamed! Truth of the matter is only reason they died is because hospital wouldn‚Äôt take them or any doctor would come out and treat them! Utter shite he died in pain and alone!
2533,2020-05-08,Good luck mate. My mother is in Wrexham living with dementia and has seen only her carer for 7 weeks and now isn't sure where she is living because she hasn't been outside once. Not sure Welsh government really care about her as long as they are seen to be covid cautious.
2534,2020-05-08,I live in Vic - my family is in WA with closed borders. I cannot see my mother with dementia in a transition geriatric psyche ward. I run a large org supporting the most disadvantaged @DanielAndrewsMP as hard as it is - I am prepared for all to wait  and  see. #covid #auspol
2535,2020-05-08,My kids painted a picture of a rainbow and gave it to their aunt who works with dementia covid patients. Do you have a problem with this kind of thing?
2536,2020-05-08,My dad passed away with Covid-19 on 23rd April but also suffered from dementia and so was almost a blessing in disguise. I hope your mum is in a happy place and can enjoy the day
2537,2020-05-08,"My mother in law died last week. Passed 2 covid tests. Then tested positive for covid in hospital. Dementia, pneumonia and covid on her death certificate. But she has been unwell for years. So old age got her."

2540,2020-05-08,And then you have councils like Derbyshire setting up a wing in care home for dementia residents for Covid patients from the community not the care home itself using the same staff both both units my mother is In there can‚Äôt get DCC or MP for scrutiny @RuthGeorge6
2541,2020-05-08,"Some are, trust me. My uncle is in hospice with dementia and has contracted covid .. üòî"
2542,2020-05-08,Studying Dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs... knowing my grandma has had it for the last 3 years and now I can‚Äôt even go see her because of COVID is depressing üòî
2543,2020-05-07,UPDATE: My father dementia care facility has found additional cases of #COVID. Seems like it is spreading among residents. Inquiring if to see if my father has been tested yet and what the results are.
2544,2020-05-07,"One of my university buddies ... his 53 year old wife came down with COVID, going from normal to delirious in two hours. More on this, some other time. This same buddy ... his 95 year old Mom, who suffers from advanced dementia, is IN a CHSLD üò¨"

2546,2020-05-07,"Current @BanTheBBC Ministry of Truth Brain Cell Count = 0.0035%. Sorry, just made those figures up off the top of my head. Kind of like you. Your stupidity is as dangerous to the Health of the County as #Covid_19 , #AIDS and #dementia combined."
2547,2020-05-07,"Today was special, I got to sing happy birthday to my nan outside her window at her care home. She sang back and it was the best feeling ever. First time I've seen her since covid as she is has dementia. So grateful she doesn't feel the absence like we do. Love you nan ‚ù§"
2548,2020-05-07,"It's not easy keeping residents away from other residents it's even harder if they have dementia as they don't understand stay in your room, that's not right, my mum works in a place what has turned it into a covid home"
2549,2020-05-07,"I totally agree with you Denise, how did they get away with it. And the police there aswel. My dad's in hospital with covid and dementia I can't go and see him. It wrong"
2550,2020-05-07,My dementia Dad remains on the COVID floor at Jackson. Test taken a week ago considered lost. Retested with results expected in a couple/few days. He has now been doped up and unable to have pt after hip surgery for over 10 days.
2551,2020-05-07,My mom is 65 and lives in a nursing home due to severe Lewy Body Dementia. Almost half of the people living there have died from Covid-19.
2552,2020-05-07,"Another tale from the COVID+ dementia ward: a pt complimented me on having ‚Äúa warm smile‚Äù. I was wearing my N95, faceshield, and spacesuit. Eyes got a bit watery, NGL."
2553,2020-05-07,"Give her some slack, she supports an adulterous man, lier, mobster, w dementia, and that is the least of her worries. She probably drank so much of his Kool-aide that by the time someone gives her CoVid she won't even know 45 advocated her as collateral expense for his economy."
2554,2020-05-07,My mother in law is in a care home as she has dementia. She is recovering from Covid. A carer was walking past her room and filmed this. 
2555,2020-05-07,Am I allowed to say that having observed my mother sink into dementia over many years (and eventually die) I would prefer a quicker death by Covid.
2556,2020-05-07,ü§îMy elderly dad tested positive for Covid whilst in hospital after breaking his hip. He has dementia  and  was previously in a care home. Hes now been moved to a nursing home (where they have no cases of Covid) They needed the hospital bed they said. ü§îwhats wrong with this?!
2557,2020-05-07,"I refuse to put my mum in a care home. Even if infected staff stayed home, the management of infectious disease is inadequate. Without training or PPE they cannot contain a dementia patient with covid. People who need care can't 'self isolate' !"
2558,2020-05-07,Good morning. Beautiful here on Pacific Ocean. My little friend Mr COVID-19 to destroy all Phase 2 institutions. Hilarious. I kind of like dementia shitshow. There's talk @MFA_China will sell Treasuries @USTreasury. My friend Mr Sung Won Sohn @LoyolaMarymount thinks they might.
2559,2020-05-07,"I think the toughest thing about COVID in my family is not being able to see my Gran. She's got terminal cancer and dementia and is deteriorating quickly now, and it breaks my heart that I can't go over and be with her, and support my Grandad üòû"
2560,2020-05-07,My grandmother has onset dementia  and  once a week someone has to explain Covid to her.... she doesn‚Äôt know why she can‚Äôt go out to dinner or grocery shop.
2561,2020-05-07,"I couldn't agree more. My mum recently died of Covid in a private care home charging 6k a month, denied medical care and hospitalisation and left to die alone. She was 85, had dementia so was ""not a priority"" This is a National Scandal!! Thank you for being hers and our voice."
2562,2020-05-07,I know you are following nursing homes infected with COVID-19. My mother is in one in Southern Mass close to the R.I. line. She has been there for 13 mos due to Lewy Body Dementia and is in a locked unit. This home did everything right and has kept visitors away for 60 days
2563,2020-05-07,This is absolutely true. My dear friend was asked by a local nursing home to come pick up her mother (good physical health but dementia) because they feared she would get COVID. My friend has her mom at home until this passes now. 
2564,2020-05-07,"Yesterday at my ultrasound, I met Richard. His wife of 30+ years & mother of his 2 boys has been in a nursing home with early onset dementia (she's only 55). He hasn't seen her in 3 months. This week she  and  her roommate tested positive for COVID-19. Praying for their family today."
2565,2020-05-07,Morning @mrjamesob found out yesterday my Dad with Louis body‚Äôs dementia in a care home is incredibly unwell. Non responsive. It‚Äôs just a matter of time.

2568,2020-05-07,"Proud to say my wife is a nurse, working in a nursing facility caring for those afflicted with Alzheimers and dementia. Extremely relieved that her COVID-19 test came back negative. We don't see her much, bc she's there for such long hours and will continue to be. #LoveMyNurse"
2569,2020-05-06,I haven‚Äôt seen my Dad in two+months now. He‚Äôs in the NYS Veterans Home in Montrose. We talk often but he‚Äôs falling deeper into his dementia.

2570,2020-05-06,"But like the guy on the tv, that's saying it's high because of obese people. My sis in law buried her mum today, a covid victim, she also had dementia. My s.i.l lost her uncle and aunty too, in 10 days before her mum. None of them were obese."

Makes me so sad, I love that lil lady so muchüò™"
2576,2020-05-06,Yes what works for other seniors DOES NOT work with seniors with dementia. Fortunately/not I am keeping my mom home until we can get more humane conditions at LTC. Solitary confinement is cruel and unusual punishment. Not to mention keeping/move-in Covid+ patients into facility
2577,2020-05-06,My elderly uncle died at the weekend in a care home. He had advanced dementia. He tested negative for covid and today it is on his death certificate as cause of death. FFS..... what is going on?
2578,2020-05-06,"Yeah I didnt know of that Jacinda quote/comment.

2579,2020-05-06,"Let me give you a thought experiment based on my own experience: I have had Covid 19. I live in a different town to my parents. My Dad has dementia. Mum cares for him at home, usually with support but not at the moment as he is so high risk. Do I travel to help Mum care for Dad?"

2582,2020-05-06,I lost my beautiful Nanna on Monday and I‚Äôm so sad. She was 94 and lived a wonderful life before dementia took parts of her away. Covid means that we‚Äôre not going to be able to give her the funeral she deserves. Please stay at home. 
2583,2020-05-06,#OBINGO yet again in making a political point James shows he knows nothing  and  cares even less about actual people involved - the devastating consequence of shoving dementia patients  and  frail elderly in a Nightingale hospital. My mum's care home locked down end of Feb. No Covid.
2584,2020-05-06,My Mother in Law died of Dementia and Old Age on Monday. No mention of Covid on her death certificate.
2585,2020-05-06,My mother was in a dementia unit in a care home. It was hell on Earth. She died in hospital after being attacked by another resident. If every single resident had died of Covid-19 it would have been a merciful release for them and their families. @alzheimerssoc #carehomehypocrisy
2586,2020-05-06,"my gf is over there in a nursing home working,just finished at the hospital. Says its as horrific as sm reports. no equipment, severely understaffed 1 nurse 20 pts or 40 if other calls out. all covid +, dementia, falls constantly bc 0staffing, they cry everyday. Shes working 6"
2587,2020-05-06,I‚Äôm sorry about your son. My grandma didn‚Äôt have COVID but she spent the final month of her life without a single visitor because of the lockdown. She has dementia  and  probably couldn‚Äôt understand why nobody was visiting. She only got 2 visitors when she died.
2588,2020-05-06,And on top of all that My grandma died Sunday morning. One of my favorite persons in the whole world. Gone. Dementia not covid but not surrounded by family cuz covid.
2589,2020-05-06,"My mom has tested positive for COVID. She is in a dementia care facility in New Jersey where cases are multiplying by the day. Please pray for her and those who live within her center, where very few patients are under the age of 65 and most have underlying conditions. #COVID19"
2590,2020-05-06,I hope cures and prevention is found sooner rather than later.. My paternal grandmother had Parkinson‚Äôs and dementia at the end. Though right now one fears whether blood clots are clumping inside one a la Covid more than anything else. A healthy mind and body are truly blessings
2591,2020-05-06,"""CDC do NOT report mysterious decline in mortality statistics for standard flu/pneumonia/renal failure & other diabetic issues/liver, heart & lung disease/advanced cancer/dementia, alzheimers and plain old age""... Maybe we should be looking into ""COVID-19""'s curative properties?"
2592,2020-05-06,make our home dementia safe or whatever. because the ideal situation would be to have someone tend to her in the mornings when my moms at work and im at school andjlsf its a lot to think abt with covid anyways but if anyone has any like anything
2593,2020-05-05,"Oh, how utterly divine. My day began with FaceTiming end-of-life care to a woman with dementia who died of COVID alone in a nursing home. This is a beautiful, redemptive way to begin new life. Welcome, little one."
2594,2020-05-05,"One of the side issues of COVID for elderly patients (and maybe the young, I'm speaking from my personal experience w/Mom), is that extended isolation causes ""institutional dementia."" It's just from being alone too long. It can be quite disconcerting if you encounter it."
2595,2020-05-05,"Agree, mine is scornful, vicious laughing. Similar here. Couldn't attend neighbour's funeral at start of lockdown, and we have cousin's aunt (dementia but put down as COVIDüòû) funeral Thurs. My mum, who I can't visit, very upset that I can't represent family there."
2596,2020-05-05,"My wife works on a dementia ward, had a patient come in from covid ward clean from virus, 2 swabs showed no trace of virus. He passed away, put it down to covid. Fuckin disgrace"
2597,2020-05-05,Lotsof people including myself did not realize how bad covid was.We did not get the truth from China.China is hiding/not sharing what they know and lying about their numbers.This hit 185 other countries.not only u.s. Not a reason to vote for a man with dementia.
2598,2020-05-05,"She had dementia and had not been herself for a long time. A person returned to the care home from the hospital, without being tested or knowing she had covid. My uncle said they knew she had covid. The virus spread through the home and unfortunately the outcome was grave!"
2599,2020-05-05,From personal experience (pre Covid) that‚Äôs often a way people ‚Äúchoose‚Äù to go. It is truly heartbreaking. My M-in-law is currently incommunicado in a care home. With dementia. It‚Äôs kinda hard to process this much shit in one sitting. Wish I was still smoking. Could kill for a fag
2600,2020-05-05,"Having covid and dying from it are not the same. My mother in law died last week. Pneumonia, dementia and covid are the reasons. But she has been ill and at deaths door numerous time in the past. So did covid kill her? I think not"
2601,2020-05-05,"‚ÄúMy mom lives in a care home because of her dementia. Covid-19 keeps us from seeing her. Luckily, the caregivers make sure we video chat daily  and  they let me come to the window to bring her chocolate, nail polish  and  a magazine!‚Äù @TanyacowieCowie, #Sietar Board Member #covidkindness"
2602,2020-05-05,COVID and dementia. That‚Äôs another story. I have a friend who asks about my mother‚Äôs reaction to things related to COVID. Bless you Amanda. Bless your work related to dementia.
2603,2020-05-05,A solid 45% of my day is chasing covid peeps with dementia back to their room while they try to fight me and say their not sick while coughing all over the place
2604,2020-05-05,Just to be clear - If my dying mother loses her battle during this crisis and a doctor puts COVID as the cause of death...it will still be the dementia that has been killing her for 7 yrs that will be the actual reason They don't even have to test for it to put it on death certs
2605,2020-05-05,"My 83 year old mother in law, who lives in a muring home in New Jersey has Covid 19. She is a lifelong chain smoker with severe dementia. When she was rushed to the hospital she had a broken rib, pulmonary embolism, fever and dehydration. Sounds like death? Nope. She‚Äôs fine."

RIP dad "
2613,2020-05-05,Extremely frustrated by my grandmother‚Äôs cavalier attitude of ‚Äúif God wants me to get COVID than I‚Äôm ok with that‚Äù; especially since my grandpa is a diabetic with heart problems (plus Parkinson‚Äôs and dementia)
2614,2020-05-05,Exactly! My 82yr old Dad with dementia made that decision along with a DNR. There has to be a balance for their needs. Thousands die in nursing/care homes preCovid  and  will continue to do so after Covid due to their age  and  underlying or pre existing conditions. 1/2
2615,2020-05-05,"My neighbor's husband died on Friday. He had dementia and was in facility, tested positive for covid-19. She last saw him the end of Feb. He deserved better than to die alone"
2616,2020-05-05,"A Deadly virus is democrat""s winningest campaign strategy. We see right through it. Real cures are suppressed. Covid numbers inflated. Max fear  and  hysteria to shut down vibrant economy. All to win 2020 election running a dementia patient."
2617,2020-05-05,"Thank you for sharing, that was a good read. My mother-in-law recently passed. She was 93, had dementia 15+years, and was bedridden with a broken hip. Her death cause was listed as Covid. For political  and  financial reasons, doctors here seem to be fudging the truth."
2618,2020-05-05,"Thank you so much for doing this. My mother has dementia and is in memory care. We just found out that one resident has tested positive for COVID-19. I am so, so grateful to the staff for facilitating phone calls and video messages. It means so much!"
2619,2020-05-04,Protect your front line! Having fun designing. I had to dive back in to my creative side as I lost my grandmother last week. She did not die of Covid but it had a hand in killing her. She had dementia  and  my family took turns visiting her every week. She was not allowed 
2620,2020-05-04,"Just found out my great grandpa is in the hospital with covid...he‚Äôs got dementia and none of us are able to see him, I can‚Äôt imagine what my great grandma is going through without him right now..."

2736,2020-04-30,"In last weeks my Dad was in a nappy drugged up to eyeballs not eating or drinking his brain dying after battle with vascular dementia, the vascular dementia wasnt on death certificate but hospital aquired pneumonia was down as cause of death. Think same is happening with covid"
2737,2020-04-30,In my area the deaths have gone from 20 to one then back up to three. There's no telling over what time frame these deaths occurred or if they died with covid present or of covid or if they were tested at all.
2738,2020-04-30,Sorry about that. This is a problem though. People who don't know any one who has died as a direct result of having covid are not as pro PPE. That is one of the reasons for not taking precautions. I don't know any one neither has any one I have discussed it with in my area.

2741,2020-04-30,Excuse me and I will pray for you because my 89 year old grandma who has dementia and can no longer walk is dying from covid-19 asshole
2742,2020-04-30,"I just got some very sad news. My Grammy who was 86 years old, passed away this afternoon.

2744,2020-04-29,"People do not understand how horrible this has been on the elderly. My 83-year-old Uncle is in the hospital with an UTI, sepsis, & CoVid. Dr. says he beat CoVid. He still can‚Äôt talk or swallow well, dementia is worse. UTI was caused by lack of movement."
2745,2020-04-29,"Hi @iraglass, I lost my father last week to COVID-19  and  Dementia. This is the memorial video I created with my family to remember him. Would you watch  and  share? "
2746,2020-04-29,I've been saying that for ages pal 'I feel for you lost my dad to dementia 2012 ' I think the government are trying to blame all deaths like your own family loss on covid 'but as you say the woman never got any visits n I can only imagine your hurt 'stay strong pal üôè
2747,2020-04-29,"I'm 59, and I'm with you. My 96yo mother-in-law is in a nursing home with dementia and if she gets COVID-19, I'll be a mess."
2748,2020-04-29,"My mom, who has late stage dementia, is in an assisted living facility. Her place emails families daily with COVID reports because no visits are allowed. So grateful for this level of communication, especially because my mom‚Äôs ability to understand what‚Äôs happening varies."

2751,2020-04-29,"I miss my father so much some days, but all these headlines of couples together for 70+ years who then die from COVID-19 within hours of each other --- it would have been so hard for my mother (who in the end was in a dementia unit) and my father to have been quarantined apart.üíî"
2752,2020-04-29,"Hi Ken Listening live while working. There is a lot of discussion about deaths due to COVID-19 when patient has preexisting conditions. IMO the determining factor is: Was the patient on their deathbed before COVID-19? My mother had dementia, but passed away due to flu in 2019."
2753,2020-04-29,I‚Äôm not caring for COVID patients but I‚Äôm in healthcare caring for elderly ppl with severe dementia n Alzheimer‚Äôs. The stress of anyone bringing it into my facility is so heavy. This entire situation is so difficult n scary
2754,2020-04-29,"my mum is in a dementia care home too. They have no cases of Covid-19, have all the PPE they need. They locked down in February and will remain that way for the foreseeable future."
2755,2020-04-29,My MIL who has dementia has been declining rapidly fro 8 weeks now. She had to be hospitalized on Sunday evening in Brooklyn. The @FDNY and hospital have been so caring. As is protocol they ran a covid-19 test and expect the results to come back in a few days. #COVID19
2756,2020-04-29,My skin cancer screening was canceled. My friend‚Äôs mammogram was canceled. My dementia-suffering parent‚Äôs meds-adjustment appt was canceled. All canceled for us by drs/hosps told Covid is the only health issue to fear. Hardly IVF or ‚Äúboob jobs‚Äù

2758,2020-04-29,"My father-in-law did well to survive so far, then? Dementia  and  femoral fracture, then developed Covid in hospital. Ventilated (24 hours) and developed (bacterial) pneumonia. He‚Äôs still with us, amazingly(!)."
2759,2020-04-29,"In the midst of COVID, diseases like dementia still claim lives. Lost my friend John today after a 5 yr fight w/ Alzheimer‚Äôs. üíî He lived life, loved cute guys  and  dressing in drag! "
2760,2020-04-29,Dementia  and  me. I miss my mom. The person I FT w now is a stranger. She's 66. Her 1st grandchild is due in 6 wks. My heart is breaking bc I have to tell her she can't hold her granddaughter bc of COVID. Her home will b locked down 6+ weeks after restrictions lifted.
2761,2020-04-29,"My father's doctor called to check up on him. He's 93 with dementia, cared for at home. She asked what the plan was if Dad caught COVID. My Dad hates hospitals, so I asked about other options. You know what? There aren't any."
2762,2020-04-29,Grandma with alzheimers and dementia passed to COVID. My mom was her sole caretaker until she was put into assisted living.
2763,2020-04-29,"Just from one case, personal experience, my grandad's brother in law was in a care home (seemingly physically fit, apart from dementia,) him and his friend in the home have both died within two weeks (details not clear of cause of death) but they've said it's not covid."
2764,2020-04-29,My mother is in a care home suffering with dementia. The home locked down over a week before the Government directive. Only staff and medical staff are allowed in. At present they are COVID free.
2765,2020-04-29,"My friend lost both of her parents in the last couple of weeks both in their 80‚Äôs one had cancer and was expected the other dementia, both were put down as Covid 19 she was told neither of them died from the virus"
2766,2020-04-29,"My mother in law is in a home. She‚Äôs only 72 but has severe dementia - if she doesn‚Äôt get COVID (which will kill her as she has v reduced lung capacity), she will have totally forgotten us all by the time we see her again."
2767,2020-04-29,Impossible to explain and isolate people with dementia my mum cries every facetime asking me to visit her She doesn't understand she feels.confused and abandoned We have never been apart for more than a week in our life I worry about her mental state as well as covid 19
2768,2020-04-29,"So you prefer a geriatric democratic establishment puppet who consistently shows signs of early dementia over a man who built a great economy, added millions of jobs, record low unemployment, and brought us to THOUSANDS less covid deaths than originally projected? Got it."
2769,2020-04-29,"Prayers up for my family. My Uncle Troy just passed and I‚Äôve also been informed my grandmother with dementia is in quarantine at the nursing home. She‚Äôs been in contact with someone who tested positive for Covid. She‚Äôs very confused right now, and could just use some prayers."
2770,2020-04-29,Why is there less talk on it? Why are they not offering it? My aunt just passed away today from covid and the doctors said hydrochloraquine was not an option given her medical condition. She only had dementia
2771,2020-04-28,"I haven't worked for many years while taking care of a dementia-suffering parent. Near 60, my resume barely gets chosen by the algorhythms. No welfare for me. No Covid-19 bailout Cadillacs courtesy of PMJT. I had already slipped between the cracks before C.19 appeared."
2772,2020-04-28,"Just lost another Great uncle today due to Covid-19. Its even more fucked up bc my grandpa, who lives with us has dementia is upstairs and has no idea wats goin on, or that his baby brother just passed away today! This life stuff is crazy bruh! Plz keep my fam in ur prayers! üôèüèæ"
2773,2020-04-28,"My Uncle Gene died early this morning. He did not have COVID-19; he had dimentia, but the family is struggling to think that he died alone. No one should die alone. üò¢"
2774,2020-04-28,I was concerned earlier by those saying it was good for dementia patients in nursing homes to be tested. My mum who is scared anyway as she can't understand what's happening even before covid would be traumatised and fight/resist this test. She would see it as a physical attack.
2775,2020-04-28,"I know full well how hard care homes are trying to cope, my father who has dementia is in one. My wife works in a respite centre for people with learning disabilities that has recently started accepting covid positive patients discharged from hospital."
2776,2020-04-28,Same here my mum died in care in 2017 before Covid 19 but because she had dementia her death was attributed to that with no other investigation at the time we accept the opinion but will never know the true cause because it is easier to go with status quo
2777,2020-04-28,Right I am sick of this I have 3 friends one is in A&E one works in a dementia care home and one works in critical care on a covid ward my brother in law is a cleaner on a normal ward all different places they have NEVER not had PPE when they have been doing there job
2778,2020-04-28,Week 4 of #redeployment  and  exhaustion is setting in.

2779,2020-04-28,"This happened to my Nan,She was in hospital then taken to a care home after being diagnosed with Vascular dementia when she left the hospital she was not tested for COVID-19. She was tested for this after having a fever and it came back positive and she passed away two days later"

2784,2020-04-28,Just to be clear - If my dying mother loses her battle during this crisis and a doctor puts COVID as the cause of death....it will still be the dementia that has been killing her for 7 yrs that will be the actual reason. Essential reading 
2785,2020-04-28,"My aunt who has dementia and other health issues was due to be released over 2 months ago until hospital social workers found out she owns her own house and has money, they said she now needs specialist care and can‚Äôt be released, now she has tested positive for Covid 19,"
2786,2020-04-28,"My brother in law is in a Care home with COVID deaths, too confused by dementia to process what the hell is going on. I expect you and every healthcare professional, everyone in PH and every scientist and politician to give each one the respect they deserve, inc by counting them"
2787,2020-04-28,My partner works at a care home for people with dementia. They have shit PPE. She contracted Covid about 10 days ago. She is off work and ill. She is not being paid and they are pestering for her to go back. Damn right they are being shat upon.
2788,2020-04-28,"My beautiful, sweet 95yo grandmother died yest morning after a long battle w/ dementia. It had been two months since we last saw her bc of COVID + nursing home rules.

2789,2020-04-28,In the last week a nurse and domestic at my mams hospital have died. Shes working on the dementia ward that is full of covid patients who sadly are being given palliative care only. Its so sad to see her come home upset because the patients she has grown to look out for are dying
2790,2020-04-28,"This sucks, my dad, who has dementia, is taken to hospital, chest pain, arm pain, throwing up, they can't treat any condition until covid test comes back. He can answer their ?'s. I can't go to hospital, I can't go to where my mom is since the whole community is in lockdown."
2791,2020-04-28,"tw; death my yiayia tested positive for covid, i knew it was a possibility and then knew it was gonna happen when 3 people in her building tested positive. shes 91 and has bad dementia. i know this will kill her and im happy she wont be in pain anymore but/"
2792,2020-04-28,My gramps passed at 96 this weekend in hospice. Has dementia. Can't wait to see Death certificate that list COD. I'm suspecting PAH due to covid 19 to be listed
2793,2020-04-28,"Saddened today to see, yet again, how many people in care homes have lost their lives :( it makes me weep. My dads best mans wife was one of them, yes she had dementia, but covid took her and it wasn‚Äôt her time to go :( something has gone horribly wrong."
2794,2020-04-28,My Mother in law died last Sunday in a care home. The death certificate says dementia but her lawyer was told by the home that she hadn't been well for the past week before. It is very suspicious to me and I am convinced she had covid-19.
2795,2020-04-28,"Watch our #DementiaCovid19 webinar 'Sharing experiences from the frontline' which is now online on the Dementia Academy website, together with links to resources and useful literature around care and support for #dementia  and  #Alzheimers in a COVID-19 world "

2798,2020-04-28,"my mother is in a nursing home, is 96 with dementia. She has an end of life plan, which includes nursing her if she ever infected with the virus. Nursing homes are fully aware of infection control There is thankfully no COVID in the home my mother is in  and  there are many more"
2799,2020-04-28,"Maybe it‚Äôs a myth at your hospital, it definitely isn‚Äôt at my wife‚Äôs. Restraining dementia patients with Covid-19 for four hours without a proper gown is a disgrace. And those testing figures? That‚Äôs capacity, not tests carried out."
2800,2020-04-28,"Loved it, cried & laughed throughout as so much resonated! Lost my partner suddenly last yr & my dad, who has dementia, is in a care home, kicking covid 19's ar*e might I add! Thank you Ricky for putting our thoughts  and  feelings out there for others to see!"
2801,2020-04-28,"Also my great grandma who is frail and has bad dementia and emphysema, contracted COVID, and I‚Äôm worried about my grandmother because she won‚Äôt be able to see her own mother on her death bed, and she‚Äôs upset."
2802,2020-04-28,Scientific advice üôÑ my dad contracted Covid from NHS frontline workers. Maybe if the government had concentrated on testing workers this wouldnt have happened! Get these workers PPE for gods sake! #COVID19 #safeguarding #coronavirus #everylifematters #PPE #care #dementia #NHS
2803,2020-04-28,Yup. Still broke. Lost my mom to Covid and dad is in the same nursing home battling Covid19 himself with a TBI  and  dementia. üòî
2804,2020-04-28,A university friend of my mum's isn't having an easy time of it. She and her elderly parents have all had COVID-19. Her father just passed away from the virus. He was 96 and also had dementia.
2805,2020-04-28,"Hey guys. My Grandma Elsa was diagnosed with COVID. She's 97  and  has dementia. I'm not close, but Dad is, moreso since she moved into a nursing near him. Dad is a very closed man -- but I could hear the pain in his voice when he called me. Prayers would be appreciated."
2806,2020-04-28,Just found out that my favorite Aunt is in hospital (not due to COVID-19) and she‚Äôll eventually be moved to a nursing home. She had a stroke a few years ago and has started declining the last several months. Dementia is getting bad  and  fluid on her lungs.
2807,2020-04-28,"Welp, I just found out my 75-year-old uncle who also suffers from dementia tested positive for COVID-19. Do me a favor and send good vibes/keep your fingers crossed, etc."
2808,2020-04-28,"You would rather have an old man with dementia and a 50 year history and government that created most of the problems having to be dealt with now, then the guy that perhaps you can‚Äôt stand personally but had a booming economy before Covid?"
2809,2020-04-27,I'm 65 and married to a wife of 78. She is in morbid dementia. We live a pleasant life. It is not easy. I lost my support group when covid-19 broke out.
2810,2020-04-27,I'm happy to have been able to provide a few thoughts and my support to those who are providing care during this extraordinary time. Thank you @AlzAuthors #Dementia #Alzheimers #Caregivers #caregiving #Covid_19
2811,2020-04-27,"Good to hear @AndyBurnhamGM on @BBCNewsnight: we must have an integrated health and care system in which a cancer patient and a dementia patient get the same treatment; in fighting for my dad‚Äôs care in 1992, I remember making the same point! An enduring scandal laid bare by COVID"
2812,2020-04-27,Please keep going with this. The other issue is that in deaths in care homes the MCCD is being filled in by GPs (who haven't seen the patient) as the last illness. So my mam died from Covid but her death certificate says dementia.
2813,2020-04-27,"Easier said than done, my family are in that exact situation. But do you know what we don‚Äôt care because we know our Mum who has dementia, is in a safe place. The staff are fantastic as is the owner himself, the staff have even recently moved into the home to care whilst in covid"
2814,2020-04-27,"Yes I give Dems a ton of shit on Twitter. But this might be the cringiest thing I‚Äôve ever seen in my life. Someone should test them for early onset dementia, not COVID-19 ü•¥ "
2815,2020-04-27,My friends dad died last night at 95 sadly with a regular chest infection... Told was covid as was my father's friend who died with dementia and parkinsons and cancer at 94 but death cert says covid!!! It's not factual unlike your constant scare mongering @piersmorgan
2816,2020-04-27,"This is the last photo I took of my grandma back in 2016 before she broke her hip. After that she spent months in rehab and couldn‚Äôt take care of herself anymore. The pain meds accelerated her dementia, and mentally she was pretty gone after that. Last night she died of covid 19. "
2817,2020-04-27,Can you just not? My wife works in a dementia ward that is directly under this path and they are overwhelmed with Covid cases among the residents and staff. They don't have enough people to deal with the panic this is going to induce
2818,2020-04-27,"I've read this too. That's why I'm asking. My friends granny died last week ""of COVID-19"", but she had dementia and cancer and was receiving end of life palliative care. She barely had a week to live anyway."
2819,2020-04-27,"Very sweet. This made me miss some of my Dementia patients. Unfortunately I stopped working the end of 2019 to start on getting a few procedures done on spine. Only had 1 so far because of Covid-19, Dr told me they r now able to get my next one scheduled at their Private facility "
2820,2020-04-27,My partner and I are taking care of my 91 year old mom 24/7 who crashed with dementia and other health issues when my dad passed away. Have not been able to get her back in Medicaid with this Covid 19 so her needed wound supplies etc have drained us to being overdrawn. Thank you

2823,2020-04-27,"A friend of mine's father died in a nursing home recently from advanced dementia and diabetes, was tested negative for covid earlier and was still recorded as dying with it. Meant my friend couldn't see him before the funeral. Criminal."
2824,2020-04-27,"That's not my point. For example, people with serious co-morbidity , e.g late stage dementia or cancer who die, and have CoVid are recorded with CoVid-19 stats. Even if they didn't necessarily have SARS."
2825,2020-04-27,"Fuck everyone else that is starving, has a business, cancer, heart disease, stroke, dementia, etc. etc. etc. They are crashing the world economy while you sat on your arse, grassed on your neighbours....well at least you didn't die of Covid thank fuk! "
2826,2020-04-27,"My Nan died this morning It was expected She was in her 90s She suffered from dementia for many years She died of Covid-19 She was born not long after the Spanish flu pandemic When I was a little boy she used to make delicious, thick custard with my grandad"
2827,2020-04-27,"""Covid not mentioned"" doesn't mean it's not killed them, or hastened their demise. Certainly not in the UK. Plus, many patients were sent back to care homes prior to the pandemic, to free up beds. This was predicted by my wife's friend, who's a ward sister in a dementia ward."
2828,2020-04-27,"Thanks PM. Platitudes. So when I speak to my 82 year old father today while he cares for my 86 year old mother, I will remind him of your words. Oh, she was returned to him from hospital Covid positive. She has got a mask but also dementia. Give that a go Bojo."
2829,2020-04-27,"It‚Äôs all about the money - no doubt in my mind that the company that runs the nursing homes was offered a substantial sum to turn one of the facilities into a COVID clinic. My grandma suffered from dementia. Horrible thing to say, but I‚Äôm glad she didn‚Äôt live to see this."
2830,2020-04-27,Please help my family. My grandma is in the final stages of dementia and only weeks left. We haven‚Äôt been able to see her because of COVID so our chance to say goodbye will be a graveside service since we can‚Äôt hold a funeral. Help with travel would be amazing. $ErinBeale1231 
2831,2020-04-26,"For people with dementia, like my mother, life is a nightmare. Covid might actually be a kindness sadly."
2832,2020-04-26,Please pray for my grandma. Someone in the retirement center she lives in has COVID. She has very dementia and cannot be isolated
2833,2020-04-26,My grandad got taken to hospital 3 days ago unrelated to COVID. My gran can't go visit him and he has dementia so he has no idea how to use a phone. It breaks my heart that they've been married for 52 years and have never spent a day apart until now

2837,2020-04-26,"My friends nan died on Thursday, she was 92. She suffered with dementia for 20 years and also had a weak heart. They didn't even test her, but have put Covid 19 on the death certificate. Shameful"

2873,2020-04-24,I wonder if that changed. I really have a very distinct memory of that because it felt important and like a great move forward. Or maybe the person who gave us our PD was misinformed :-( or my covid dementia is setting in.

2949,2020-04-21,"I was born in Albany and I grew up in Fitzgerald. My mom is living at home with 24/7 caregivers there. She has dementia, and she is doing well. I watch the Georgia COVID-19 data daily and feel devastated by it. I was planning to visit this month but I'm stuck in Colorado."
2950,2020-04-21,And we‚Äôre all dealing with more than work. I‚Äôve got a father with #dementia and a high school senior schooling from home. My friends have been sick with #COVID. (5/11)

2957,2020-04-21,My dad is in an assisted living facility living with dementia and we have no ability to see him because of the COVID-19 restructions. This resonated deeply.

2961,2020-04-21,"Today I lost one of the lights of my life. Dementia took her early. At first slowly, then all at once. COVID means I can‚Äôt gather with the legions of others whose lives she touched including, most poignantly, my mom. My heart is broken. "
2962,2020-04-20,My elderly mum is in hospital now after 2 trips to emerg this weekend. Not COVID. Either very quick onset of dementia or something else. Is it wrong to pray it‚Äôs a brain tumour they might be able to do something about?

2964,2020-04-20,"I won't say 2 u what I'd like 2. I will say this instead. My dear Mom has dementia, she can't walk. She is in a nursing home. The cdc locked her in 30 days ago. 48 hrs ago the press found out covid was in the home. Mom is still ok. Now if it was your mom, is it a hoax?"
2965,2020-04-20,Physically visit my mom at her nursing home. She has dementia and all she did was cry mostly during our last window visit. It was awful sad and I‚Äôm sure uncertain to her. She recently tested positive for covid 19. Such a worry to not be by her side.
2966,2020-04-20,#cblive we have to remind people that over60% of the nursing homes are covid free so far may it stay like that. It must be worrying for all of those who have loved ones in nursing homes. my dear mother had dementia was looked after so well in a nursing homeBy wonderful people.

2974,2020-04-20,My dad informed me today that sadly my uncle died this morning. We wasn't close but still a shame to hear. All I know is he had a chest infection - not sure if it was Covid-19 related yet. He already had Lewy Body Dementia so hopefully he's at peace now.
2975,2020-04-20,I just got off the phone with my friend. This morning around 1am the doctors at Franklin Hospital confirmed her father has COVID-19. He has diabetes high blood pressure early stages of dementia. A trifecta shit health storm. She worried and scared. Me? I am pissed stay home.. 
2976,2020-04-20,I lost my grandfather to COVID-19 this morning. He had dementia and had been in a nursing facility since 2016. The last time I was hugged was in December. The last time I saw him was Friday through a fast time. The last time I spoke to him was yesterday through a phone.

2988,2020-04-19,Hi Will. We lost my mother in law on Easter Saturday to COVID. She had vascular dementia and lived with us. We have a common sense of grief  and  loss.

2989,2020-04-19,"OK, thanks. I was thinking of my mums home which had one RN on a shift (dementia care). I think if they have covid patients then they need higher ratios."

2992,2020-04-19,Just finished listening to my DIL crying because residents in the dementia ward she works in are dying from Covid 19. Not even oxygen available to ease their breathing. Heart breaking.
2993,2020-04-19,"i usually try to be better than arguing with random people on twitter. but my mom is 65 and her early-onset dementia progressed to such a degree that she needs nursing home care. and as of two days ago, there‚Äôs a covid case on her floor. dudes like this are so fucking selfish."

2996,2020-04-19,"Well, my 100-year-old great uncle has been diagnosed with Covid. He has dementia  and  is a UK care home. Nobody can visit him. I don't know what to say. I guess it was inevitable.

2999,2020-04-18,My Mum is in a care home. 93. Dementia. They phoned yesterday to say she‚Äôs being isolated with a temperature and cough. Doctor has prescribed antibiotics by phone. No COVID test available.
3000,2020-04-18,I‚Äôve lost count of how many times I‚Äôve been on the phone with my grandmother telling her that it‚Äôs not safe for her to leave the house because of COVID-19. Life with a loved one who has dementia right now is frustrating. Constantly re-teaching and remaining patient.
3001,2020-04-18,Been stressful bro. My Unc lost his battle w/ dementia and now I‚Äôm sorta thinking he may have had Covid too. Cause his son/ my cousin and both my kids parents got it a couple days after he died. They were all with him. Can‚Äôt even have a funeral for him.
3002,2020-04-18,"Thanks. The care and maintenance staff are trying their best, but they‚Äôre overwhelmed. My MIL got a new roommate last week and she still has no idea whether or not the woman, who has dementia, has received a COVID-19 test."
3003,2020-04-18,"My grandmother had dementia, she was in a home in England, and her death this morning was caused by covid-19. The last time I saw her was at my dad's funeral. Indeed Inna lillahi wa Inna Ilayhi Raji'un."

3010,2020-04-18,Even more feared than #COVID is the diagnosis of #dementia Many great points in this article but bringing joy along with you is an unexpected but practical tip-read on to how that‚Äôs possible. I can attest that my mom carried joy of music many years past family recognition üéπ‚ú® 
3011,2020-04-18,"Just been over to see my Nanna and Mum (from a safe distance) following the news my Grandad passed away last night. After suffering with Dementia for the best part of 4 years, Covid-19 took him last night. Do your bit of national service by staying indoors."
3012,2020-04-18,"Every good wish. My mother is in the same advanced state of dementia in a home, though no Covid yet. I know how worried you are. Courage!"
3013,2020-04-18,I‚Äôm sorry for your loss. My elderly mother is in hospital with Covid. She has dementia and no family member can be with her.
3014,2020-04-18,"Hi Sonia, stay strong my mam is 88 and was in a care home with dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs . She was rushed into hospital at 4am 10 days ago with suspected covid -19. She was later tested positive but gladly she seems to have beat it and on the mend now. Take care x ."
3015,2020-04-18,My mum is in the same position with advanced dementia.They thought she had covid and then said chest infection (no tests) but they have had two die of suspected Covid and yet still no tests. They are waiting for Health Protection SCotland to arrange .
3016,2020-04-18,This is a love letter to my Dad through the medium of food. My 81 yo Dad is cocooning with my 79 yo Mum who has progressed dementia. Up until #Covid_19 he got out for a round of golf with his mates three times a week supported by our kind and patient Carer Bonno.
3017,2020-04-18,I work with people with dementia. My experience is that the ageism and ableism has always been there. Covid-19 has merely turned the volume up on a pretty ugly attitude towards our elders and how little we value them
3018,2020-04-18,"I come from a care home background my care home mates are petrified there is no containing covid in there once it‚Äôs in ...how can you expect a dementia patient to understand any of this they can‚Äôt, they wander around the house daily life is confusing enough for them üòû"
3019,2020-04-18,my gran was rushed to hospital last night and has been confirmed to have covid-19 and it‚Äôs not looking good for her. she‚Äôs had dementia for about 5 years now so she‚Äôs not really been with us properly for a couple of years. most worried for my mum.
3020,2020-04-18,"My Aunt who had dementia passed away in her care home. First positive Covid case in her home, after 14 days carers reported she was out of bed, eating and chatting. Day later feeling tired she 'unusually' went for a lie down, they found she'd slept away a short time later. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
3021,2020-04-18,"""The BBC person said, gently, you don‚Äôt sound, the way you‚Äôre talking, as if you are very affected by your dementia. I mean, I know you‚Äôve got it, but‚Ä¶ Well, I said, if I were not taking my pills I would be unable to put a sentence together, or do much else"". #dementia #Covid_19"
3022,2020-04-18,Scenes from Covid-19 UK: 14 people have died in the care home where my Dad (with dementia) is. Very worrying but so far he‚Äôs OK.
3023,2020-04-18,The @ons figures certainly paint a stark picture of covid19 deaths and dementia in various age brackets. My dads was listed as covid 19/lbs Though he had mixed dementia. Clearly scope for looking at impact on different types of dementia. The category heading? Why? 
3024,2020-04-18,"My Mum is the same age, same health circumstances regarding dementia and it must be 6 weeks since I last saw her although like you, no doubt, we have spoken. So far there has been no covid outbreak. We live on a knife edge and are helpless. Love to you and your Mum x"
3025,2020-04-18,"On Thursday morning my wonderful, kind grandmother passed away after a suspected short battle with COVID-19, and a long battle with dementia. We‚Äôre completely heartbroken. #StayHome"
3026,2020-04-18,"This is such a good thread and makes absolute sense. I‚Äôm worried sick about covid getting into my mums nh, non verbal dementia. Such a vulnerable group."
3027,2020-04-18,Well here goes my likelihood of ever getting into USA for a holiday. What the f*** is the matter with you yanks? Standing on some steps with a big f***in gun to match the big fat belly doesn't defeat COVID. Led by some utter moron who is slipping into dementia
3028,2020-04-18,Thanks @clairearowley for the nomination. What 3 thgs are you doing for your #mentalhealth in Covid times? 1) watching terrible TV 2) painting the house 3) spending time with my cat in my much cherished garden How about you @DrSarahAW @IsabelleMalhame @sarahthemedic
3029,2020-04-18,"I absolutely don't underestimate this, and I agree. We take care of my mom, who has pretty advanced dementia, and many of my decisions are focused first on what keeps her safe. It's more helping make sure volunteers know to use PPE properly and can get quick safety training."
3030,2020-04-18,"The nurse said my mother did not suffer. The nurse also said my mother died from vascular dementia, and not from COVID-19. I failed my mother. But at least she is no longer suffering."
3031,2020-04-18,I've been really missing my dad. He has Alzheimer's and lives at a premium dementia care facility in CT and I live in WI. All the news about COVID-19 and nursing homes is freaking me out and I'm afraid if I call or facetime I'm going to lose it.
3032,2020-04-18,I did my best and I had one floor living that made it better. But you have to be up nearly 24 hours a day to care for a person with dementia. It was like having my 2 year old ripped from arms when she went in. they really cared for her. But they are not equipped for COVID.
3033,2020-04-17,"Sonia I have not seen my mother for 6 weeks, she is 90 with dementia, alone and confused. Fearing she may get exposed to Covid sat here terrified and sad. I feel our vulnerable people have been sacrificed by this government. I wish your mum well."
3034,2020-04-17,We think he is impacted. I pray it's nothing worse. I cannot take this on top of my dad having cancer on top of my grandma's dementia on top of covid 19. I need good news. I need a break.
3035,2020-04-17,"Yet another nail in the coffin (pardon my metaphor) of ever knowing the real numbers of deaths! Some GP's record 'dementia' as a cause of death despite there being good reason to use COVID-19! It's not paranoid to assume it's a conspiracy, is it?"
3036,2020-04-17,"Similar: My mother is 91, has dementia and lives in a care home that has been shut to visitors including me for nearly 3 weeks. Yesterday she tested -ve for covid. I miss her and fear for everyone in care homes even good ones like hers"
3037,2020-04-17,"Big involvement in carrying out Covid procedures within a Dementia care home this week. Having to deal with a pandemic in this setting is a new world of pressure. I implemented my nursing knowledge into practice, it helped others  and  I‚Äôm proud of that #studentnurse #ClapForCarers"
3038,2020-04-17,"Yes. He was 83. He was in a care facility suffering from dementia. He was frail, he caught COVID and it took him. Thank you! I am in this fight because of my dad. He would not want us chained down by our government. He served his country in the Army. We live to be free!"
3039,2020-04-17,just found out my aunt who lives in a nursing home and has dementia: 1. can‚Äôt remember I exist 2. tested positive for COVID this is not what I wanted to hear :(
3040,2020-04-17,"I‚Äôm a researcher who studies dementia. Today, I got word that one of the participants in my current study has died of COVID-19. I can‚Äôt tweet any information about her, but she was an enthusiastic participant in many of my past studies, and I will miss her."
3041,2020-04-17,"My mother is 91, has advanced dementia and lives in a care home that has been shut to visitors including me for nearly 6 weeks. Today she tested positive for covid. I miss her terribly and fear for everyone in care homes even good ones like hers"
3042,2020-04-17,This is happening more and needs to be addressed. My Dad was placed in a home after a hospital stay earlier this week. The Social Worker assured us it was safe. We were lied to- the facility has 7 confirmed COVID cases. We can't speak to my father or see him and he has Dementia.
3043,2020-04-17,"I don't know you but my heart absolutely aches for you, & others going through the same thing. I have a friend, her husband is in care facility. This same thing will play out, he is having terminal restlessness right now. Not Covid, but dementia and she's not allowed to see him."
3044,2020-04-17,2 positive #Lockdown #COVID things today: 1. My Mum is putting on weight #Dementia 2. I finally managed to get a @Tesco Delivery slot for my parents after much constant checking online since the last delivery! Again his sense of relief is palpable (as is mine!) #CovidUK #Elderly
3045,2020-04-17,My grandma got tested positive for the COVID-19  and  I don‚Äôt know how to feel about it. Especially since I haven‚Äôt talked to her in years  and  she already has dementia
3046,2020-04-17,My dad has multiple co-morbidities along with dementia. I am more afraid of the isolation killing him than COVID. He lives in a senior living facility where he can‚Äôt come out of his small apartment and only his caregiver can go in to give him his meds. Otherwise he‚Äôs alone.
3047,2020-04-17,"Bouquets üíê to @heather_edelson and @MelisaFranzen for an outstanding TOWN HALL MEETING on Covid, last evening. Thank you for addressing my concerns re isolation for persons living with dementia. More to come. #socializationisparamount"
3048,2020-04-17,"Today is my mom‚Äôs 85th birthday. We may speak by phone, but nursing home staff stretched 2 thin now that there r covid cases. She thought birthdays were bullshit anyhow. Hope the grace of dementia brings her a birthday lunch @gardnermuseum w her adoring opinionated kids ‚ù§Ô∏èüéÇ"
3049,2020-04-17,"You know how stubborn your Gran was? triple bypass,Gammy leg, dementia and lung cancer but still refused to go to hospital with the sniffles Because she was afraid ‚ù§Ô∏èWe‚Äôll guess what?she just died of COVID because CDC said soü§ßThey just don‚Äôt care I call it fudging the numbersü§ì "
3050,2020-04-17,"I can only tell you, what my kids tell me (kids 36 & 33). One a radiology consultant working 3 day/50 hour shifts in a Covid 19 unit, the other a carer for dementia patients. Both say it's uplifting and certainly not pointless. I doubt those on the bridge were on emergency duty."
3051,2020-04-17,"Telephone visit with my 82 patient. He said: doctor I‚Äôm getting confused and sleeping too much, do I have dementia? ME: I‚Äôm hearing you cough, I can hear your wheezes and that you are breathing hard. Sent him to ED-likely COVID."
3052,2020-04-17,Hes not stuttering he has dementia. I have had family members with it and i can see the signs. I don't understand when the country is doing great you guys get so pissed off. Before the covid-19 the economy was open for everyone. Black and Hispanic employment was at its highest
3053,2020-04-17,"Got my lovely nannie a brilliant dementia-friendly puzzle from @ActiveMindsUK. It's the first one she's ever done in her life, she said. Only needed a little bit of help and she's super pleased with herself. Her little face üò≠üòç‚ù§Ô∏èüëè #lockdownuk #Covid_19 #grandparents #Activity"
3054,2020-04-17,"My wife and me are in our 50s. Poor diet was killing us. And our peers. Long before COVID-19. In our age group people have cancer, early dementia, CVD, autoimmune, kidney failure, renal failure, pulmonary disorders, T2, mental disorders. All with huge diet/epigenetic causes. "
3055,2020-04-17,"My father died of dementia 21 years ago, my stepfather 7. I was coincidentally assigned the nursing home my stepfather died at for part of a covid monitoring volunteer project and every day I wonder how we‚Äôd care for him at home we‚Äôre he alive."
3056,2020-04-17,after becoming really poorly with CPOD and dementia my grandad now has been tested positive for Covid-19ü•∫ i am praying he gets through this !!!!
3057,2020-04-17,"My heart goes out to both of you as I can identify with your pain. Dementia is hard enough on the family and with Covid 19, it is just so much worse."
3058,2020-04-17,"My mom passed of dementia last week amidst this Covid mess. It is a long, hard road, and each unfamiliar phone call is it‚Äôs own hell. We all respond differently, but always with compassion. Sometimes to our loved ones, sometimes to those around us, and sometimes to our selves."
3059,2020-04-17,"My 90-year-old uncle, previously weakened by serious heart and mobility issues, as well as by the stress of supporting my aunt as she drifts into dementia, was nevertheless surviving. That is until COVID-19 and treatment with hydroxychloroquine took him from us today. RIP."
3060,2020-04-17,My mom is on lockdown in a retirement home. To date no one has it and I am grateful. My dad was in a dementia ward and passed away in 2018. I am thankful he was spared COVID. He would not have understood why he was alone and that would have killed mom. Small blessings.
3061,2020-04-17,My grandmother‚Äôs dementia has accelerated on a parabolic curve through this covid bullshit. I blame every politician and pundit who called for a complete closing of the economy for a bad flu. You bastards are culpable.
3062,2020-04-17,I'm in the same situation with my mom. I'm worried that she'll get COVID or her dementia will worsen and I won't get a chance to see her before this is over or talk to her while she still knows who I am. I will pray for you and your dad. I hope you can be together again soon.
3063,2020-04-17,"I can't make this up. Pt in my #LTC w/ COVID is #DNR. Has dementia,1 child is #POA (1 who signed DNR) and knows it's mom's true wishes. But POA is thinking of changing bc a sibling (who just threatened me on the phone w/ lawsuit) is bullying POA. I'm standing up for my patient."
3064,2020-04-16,I had to get a new job due to Covid. I‚Äôm now working with dementia patients in a retirement home (I love it)and while we‚Äôre not on the front lines it‚Äôs still scary to know me and my residents are at risk. The hours aren‚Äôt great and any financial gift would be a huge blessing
3065,2020-04-16,My professor‚Äôs elderly mother has dementia and now has COVID-19. She will likely die soon. My professor did not cancel class and felt as though she couldn‚Äôt interrupt class to answer the nursing homes phone. My classmates spoke up and told her to take the call and just call break
3066,2020-04-16,"Update on this lady: Home from the hospital, recovering from pneumonia, no COVID! She does have a growing heart aneurysm and newly diagnosed, dementia, however. I appreciate your prayers and kind words and ask that you continue to keep my grandma in your thoughts. She is tough... "
3067,2020-04-16,my grandpa had a fever this morning and other people at his nursing home (he has dementia) have covid-19 :(( i‚Äôm so worried
3068,2020-04-16,"My mother-in-law is 75 and has advanced dementia. We haven‚Äôt been able to visit her at the nursing home in more than a month,  and  today they called B to tell him she has a fever  and  they‚Äôre moving her to isolation. It‚Äôs hopefully not COVID b/c they have no other cases there."
3069,2020-04-16,My grandma has covid. She‚Äôs in hospital so I can‚Äôt see her. She has final stage dementia and she gets spooked by hospitals real easily. I‚Äôm scared for her.
3070,2020-04-16,"Today I went to my second funeral this year. My Aunt passed away from Dementia, not COVID 19 related. She was looked after by staff at the care home and NHS staff at the hospital. All amazing. #ClapForCarers #ThursdayThoughts #StayHomeSaveLifes #spring #PHOTOS"
3071,2020-04-16,"Having my partner on the frontline (manager of a dementia home) dealing with Covid-19 has suddenly become all too real,  and  I now fear for him, me and the kids- he can‚Äôt isolate and we can‚Äôt really isolate from him, plus we‚Äôve already been exposed. I‚Äôve got to step up... "
3072,2020-04-16,My mother has Vascular Dementia and is in a care home. They restricted visiting and excluded visitors from communal areas when the severity of Covid 19 became apparent. This was My mother has Vascular Dementia and is in a care home.
3073,2020-04-16,#COVID19 just hit home. I have a friend whose mother is in a Seattle nursing home. The nursing home contacted her this morning to let her know her mother has #COVID. It‚Äôs a death sentence. She‚Äôs 80 and has dementia. And my friend won‚Äôt be able to see her before she passes...
3074,2020-04-16,"My mum's in a care home with dementia. So far no cases there. Haven't seen her for a month, which is tough. TBH I think the number of people who play out their last years in these circumstances is a more intractable problem than COVID-19"
3075,2020-04-16,"My uncle has dementia and has been in the hospital with covid. He is so confused...(no visitors, where he is, whats going on) his organs are shutting down and has 2-3 days to live. Please stay home. Please. #COVID19"

3077,2020-04-16,Im a carer in a care home so this covid 19 business is an extra worry on top of the other challenges we face daily i.e. dementia and other problems our residents have. Not to mention I have health problems myself.
3078,2020-04-16,"Coincidentally heard from my cousin in the UK today whose mother has dementia, and just found out she has COVID-19."
3079,2020-04-16,So today my Great Uncle passed away in his care home. Unsure if it was #dementia or #Covid_19 that was the cause. We knew it was coming and his wife was thankful to have the chance to say goodbye a few days ago. It‚Äôs strange and I don‚Äôt know how to feel.
3080,2020-04-16,Doesn't matter who you vote for. My mates sister is a paramedic. She has no masks or ppe. She was moving a covid patient with dementia last week and they coughed in her face. Its criminal she is exposed in this way. We had so much warning.

3084,2020-04-16,My poor granny just test d positive for covid-19. Please pray for her she‚Äôs so old and has dementia.
3085,2020-04-15,"I honestly don't expect my grandma to survive covid. She's 84 and diabetic, has dementia, and is in late stage heart failure anyway. So. That's a thing. I mean she's okayish now but...."
3086,2020-04-15,"My 103-year-old mother-in-law died this week (not of Covid) and none of us could see her in her last days and weeks because she lived in a facility for people with dementia. That‚Äôs was the right thing to not endanger others, but it‚Äôs still hard."
3087,2020-04-15,Absolutely. My brother is in a nursing facility with dementia. They have had 8 resident Covid deaths over the past two weeks. At first they only tested those who had close contact with the first 2 deaths. They found 14 more residents positive and 11 staff positive. 1/2
3088,2020-04-15,On the 13th April covid 19 took my grandad from me... admitted to hospital with cellulitis but contracted the virus in hospital over a week later üò¢.. please please stay safe ....we couldn‚Äôt say our goodbyes... my heart is broken üíî #COVID19 #StayHome #dementia

3091,2020-04-15,Being put on a ventilator is traumatic enough for young people. ICU is no place for a frail elderly person. My 89 yr old Mother has early dementia  and  Covid-19  and  is in hospital. There‚Äôs no easy answer  and  no-one to blame
3092,2020-04-15,"Walked into my #nursinghome where #COVID is ravaging all of us to discover 1 of our staff, an amazing #CNA who dedicated his life to dementia pts (was so amazing w/them/worked here 14yrs!) died this morning from covid. I can‚Äôt even....and so much work to do. This is awful"

3094,2020-04-15,"And in other news, my Mum's 90 year old next door neighbour, many underlying health conditions, inc. dementia, has survived Covid-19. As has her 58 year old daughter. Remarkable."
3095,2020-04-15,"How moving, what a lovely response to help her mom understand. I lost my mom to covid last Friday, she had dementia too‚ù§Ô∏è"
3096,2020-04-15,This has really got to me the last few weeks. Glad both my Dear Dad and Nanna aren't here through this. I cannot imagine going through terminal cancer and dementia as well as COVID-19 with them. When all you want to do is be by their side. Well done @GOVUK #StayHomeSaveLives
3097,2020-04-15,"Aunt with dementia in a Manhattan assisted living facility. 3 of ~60 residents have died of COVID, another dozen are suspected of having it. Including my aunt. No way of isolating her (too short staffed; workers sick too). No way of testing (no way of getting results picked up)."
3098,2020-04-15,Even though my gramma has COPD and dementia and shouldn't be living alone I am glad she wouldn't move now that all this shit is happening inside of the old folks homes (covid) she would have been a gonner.
3099,2020-04-15,"Today is my one of a kind, beautiful, and fierce Nana‚Äôs birthday. She‚Äôs my best friend and my grandmother. She‚Äôs 86 today, I‚Äôm damn proud of her. Dementia sucks.

3101,2020-04-15,If I had any kind of cognitive deficits that resembled dementia after a severe case of covid 19 It‚Äôs game over for me. I‚Äôll make sure I have all my affairs in order and  will be DNR or outright take my own life. I will NOT be a burden to myself or others.
3102,2020-04-15,"This my first yes. Hubby's Aunt, 84 died in nursing home in MI positive for covid. She had bad dementia. Sister's neighbor in TN, medical tech. Positive. Is in quarantine. Don't know anyone here in CA with it."
3103,2020-04-15,"My mum has dementia  and  is in a care home, just that alone makes me anxious for her In the current situation. She‚Äôs clearly more vulnerable to #Covid_19 without a doubt a very worrying situation for a lot of people #carehomes"
3104,2020-04-15,"Why, why would you stop inspections!! My mother is in a home with dementia and if she dies during Covid-19 he will have her blood on his hands. Do you hear that @fordnation !"
3105,2020-04-15,"My grandma died. She's got dementia before and later covid+. They can't even send the body (she's in the US), not that we can do much in this situation. This pandemic limits our action. She deserves a proper burial surrounded by family. Times are hard. Really."
3106,2020-04-15,"The worst case for re-election perspective is to open the economy and then be forced to close it again due to our workers being sick by COVID-19. Does not he have advisers that can point that out to him? Again, we live in dementia precox, we must fight it."
3107,2020-04-15,"Just found out my Aunty has Tested positive for Covid. Although she‚Äôs 87, with dementia and in Nursing Home I need all my prayers warriors to Out my aunt Dorthy in your prayers please"

3109,2020-04-15,"It focuses primarily on setting up and winning through the main line of the Pyrite Spellbomb loop, but a couple weeks before my LGS shutdown due to COVID-19 I was winning most of my paper matches with Altar of Dementia mills then using Wheel/Memory Jar to win via decking."
3110,2020-04-15,"My Grandpa went to nursing home this week due to his declining physical strength & mental status w/ dementia...  and  of course no visitors allowed.

3112,2020-04-14,So today has been tough - hearing that Covid-19 has taken away my lovely Uncle Jim. Feel so very sad but I have a heart full of memories  and  console myself that he can now rest and his dementia will no longer define the end of his life. Goodnight my kind and caring uncle üòç
3113,2020-04-14,"I have a few disposal ones, thanks for asking. It's a nightmare cuz I care for my 95yr old Mom with dementia. I had to stop her aides cuz covid is bad here. I'm shocked at number of people here who think this is an overblown hoax! Sorry for venting. You take care too, buddy."
3114,2020-04-14,"No. But my two friends work in a Covid ward at Pilgrim's Hospital, Lincolnshire with dementia patients. They, along with the other staff, constantly plead to the authorities for more ( and  effective) PPE  and  I think they know far more about it than you do."
3115,2020-04-14,Can I nominate the NHS Hereford for secretly putting my mother on a DNR order complete with instruction not to transfer her from her care home to hospital if she gets Covid 19? She‚Äôs 78 has dementia and is scared people want to hurt her!
3116,2020-04-14,So my brother just got off his 12 hour shift at the hospital. He said he had to report two nurses and his supervisor because they let a covid patient walk around the floor instead of being in isolation. They said the nurses said felt sorry for the pt since he had dementia üòêüòêüòê
3117,2020-04-14,"There is also another CV19 pain My clever brother in law, now with advanced dementia, has been in lockdown in his nursing home for 4 weeks 1 COVID resident death Everyone confined to their rooms No tests His wife, my sister can‚Äôt visit him He‚Äôs pining away, not eating/drinking"
3118,2020-04-14,"In the early hours of yesterday morning, we lost my Nan. Her #dementia didn't win, Covid-19, she escaped too, it was her heart that finally gave way, and because of the lockdown we couldn't get to her. My head is still spinning, I needed 'normal' and quickly realised that..."
3119,2020-04-14,I heard the report about people dying ‚Äúbefore their time‚Äù in dementia care homes. My mother died a slow lingering awful death of Alzheimer‚Äôs some years ago. She wasn‚Äôt lucky enough to have had Covid-19.
3120,2020-04-14,"My mum is in a nursing home in NI. She has no DNR or advance directive, never mentioned. GP called 2 weeks ago and informed us if my 87yo mum with dementia gets COVID-19, policy is she will not be transferred to hospital. Its savage and its beneath us to treat ppl this way."
3121,2020-04-14,"Visiting my brother in his nursing facility every weekend. He has dementia and I haven‚Äôt been able to visit him in over a month. They have had 8 Covid deaths in his facility, but luckily, he tested negative. I‚Äôm afraid his dementia will worsen before I see him again."
3122,2020-04-14,"I am sorry for your loss. My mother-in-law passed yesterday from COVID. She was also 91 and deep in dementia but she deserved better, as did your dad. Republicans will claim she shouldn't be counted as she should have been dead anyway."
3123,2020-04-14,"My Nan Gladys, 92 & in a care home tested Covid positive today. Fighting dementia. Very poorly. Tho the fight is not over yet. Meantime I sit in my house, my sister sits in tears at hers. My mum too. At hers. And my nan lies 'alone' at hers. So cruel. Hug who you can."
3124,2020-04-14,"When my father died his certificate indicated death from Bladder Cancer and Dementia? He did not die from Dementia but it was a contributing factor! If someone dies of Pneumonia or Heart failure, caused by Covid 19, then both should be written on their Death Certificates!"
3125,2020-04-14,"I think I'm ready to speak out now.. Four days ago, my grandma passed away from Covid-19. She was a kind and caring soul and I loved her, even though she was suffering from severe dementia in later years. She barely recongnized me, but I still loved her. Rest in Peace grandma."
3126,2020-04-14,"Totally agree! My mom, with dementia, suffered enough for staff shortages two years ago. And now this Covid-19 effect. Small mercy. "
3127,2020-04-14,"My 97 year old aunt just passed away, she tested positive for covid-19. The official ruling for death is complications from dementia. So she is not part of the statistics. Isn‚Äôt it essential to count all cases?"
3128,2020-04-14,"Just had the call I've dreaded. My nan, who has dementia  and  diabetes amongst other things  and  is in a care home has been taken to hospital. Not Covid related but the hospital has a lot of cases. Dreading what comes next. Can't deal with the thought of her being alone. üò¢üíî"
3129,2020-04-14,"Sadly after testing positive for Covid at the weekend, my dad sadly passed away this morning, due to being in care for dementia we weren‚Äôt able to be with him in his final hours, I am grateful that a member of his care team sat and held his hand through the night. "
3130,2020-04-14,And people like my brother in law with dementia in care homes are still people. Apart from dementia he is still pretty healthy. Yet there has been one death from Covid in his nursing home. No one else has been tested not even that staff moving between vulnerable residents
3131,2020-04-14,"Exactly. My mum is in a care home, she has advanced dementia. They are struggling to get supplies of PPE, wipes and sanitiser and have had one case of Covid-19. I'm posting them what I can pick up in the supermarket. The government are deluded."
3132,2020-04-14,"I don't know about representing people in care homes generally, but I'm representing my mum who is in one, with advanced dementia. They are struggling to source PPE, wipes and sanitiser and have had one case of Covid-19. I'm sending them what I can. It shouldn't come to this."
3133,2020-04-14,They are sorry to say. Where do the residents go when they get I'll? The hospital. Who cares for them when at their worst? My Daughter is a 2nd year student nurses and yesterday she cared for 4 men with dementia and Covid.
3134,2020-04-14,I lost my father to this awful virus on Easter Sunday. He died alone with his dementia. The wonderful care staff have woefully inadequate PPE yet still care tirelessly for our loved ones. Still waiting for Death certificate.. predicting no mention of Covid 19.. a national scandal
3135,2020-04-14,I want to see the figures for Covid 19 in care homes! This is a personal plea. My brother with dementia and my brother in law are both in care homes. I haven‚Äôt been able to see either in a month. 
3136,2020-04-14,I work for NHS & I‚Äôm sure I had it & haven‚Äôt been tested ! My dad is ill in hosp with confirmed Covid ! He has dementia  and  I haven‚Äôt seen him in 10days ! I don‚Äôt know any NHS friends who have had test !
3137,2020-04-14,"My grandmother is 94, has dementia, and lives in a rest home. Every time someone from a rest home dies from COVID-19, I think that it could have been her. It could so easily have been her. And my heart breaks, because I don't want to lose her."

3139,2020-04-14,"Yes and suddenly every journalist in the country is interested in care homes, yet none have bothered to research them. My mum was in a care home and had vascular dementia, if they bothered to do some research they might find out the reality - long before Covid-19"
3140,2020-04-14,To transfer elderly people with dementia to hosp would be barbaric My mother is 96 with final stage dementia has a clear end of life plan which has been put in place by GP Nurse/Manager and family COVID 19 is killing people to use the elderly as a headline grabber is offensive.
3141,2020-04-14,"I feel for you both. My mum (92) is in the dementia unit of a care home - in Brittany. No cases of Covid 19 to date, thankfully. Residents confined to own rooms, not implemented in dementia unit as IMPOSSIBLE. I am so grateful to the staff! ‚ô•Ô∏è"
3142,2020-04-14,"My mother died Thursday (dementia, not Covid)  and  funeral was today via Zoom, which piled new surreal atop existing surreal. But I think she'd have been happy that I donned a nice dress, did my hair,  and  put, as she would have said, ""a little color on [my] face."" Oh, mom."
3143,2020-04-14,I also found out tonight that my one uncle died from covid. I wasn‚Äôt close to him at all but he had been coming to holiday dinners at my dad‚Äôs and he was recently diagnosed w dementia so he‚Äôs been in a home. Nursing homes here are having outbreaks so he caught it :(
3144,2020-04-14,To be honest Kirby would probably be more likely to watch meh got excited when I sent him surgery pics. You threw up. Side note I‚Äôm extra bitter tonight cause my grandpa died of covid in the nursing home. He had dementia so good riddance but sucks for my grandmother.
3145,2020-04-14,Something positive. My dad is unable to visit my grandpa because of Covid. The home is on lockdown.. He‚Äôs currently diagnosed with dementia ...So they had a little parade for family to drive by and see them. Y‚Äôall I love my dad so much for this . üò¢üòáüò≠ 
3146,2020-04-13,"This is an incredible piece by my friend @Sokic_ about those with dementia during COVID-19. If you have a minute, this is a must readüëáüèª "
3147,2020-04-13,"Because they were probably deaths from dementia or influenza, 2 years ago my dad died from it and so did 5 others within 10 days in thy home, if he had have died this week they would have labelled it COVID-19 "
3148,2020-04-13,"My Mother, who is already suffering from Dementia, is in a nursing home in Montreal that is currently under investigation and covid-19 is running rampant. People are dying and families are terrified."
3149,2020-04-13,Hi Mandy. I quite agree. I‚Äôm a CPN working with dementia. The price these homes charge is immoral. Quite a few in my patch have residents with COVID 19. I know the staff are really scared but still do a great job#supporthecarers.
3150,2020-04-13,"As my 97 year-old Mom enters end-stage dementia and contracture sets in, I am fucking distracted by the idiot in the white house and COVID-19."
3151,2020-04-13,On whose part? My nurse daughter managing a dementia home in Cornwall. Owner of home recovering from cancer - meets her in the garden to plan. 1/3 of her team isolating. No covid in yet. 16 elderly residents. Ppe masks bought via builders merchant. There is no support.
3152,2020-04-13,"I agree. My mother is in one with advanced dementia. I'm realistic enough to understand that should she contract COVID-19 (fingers crossed she won't), she would not be a suitable candidate for a ventilator. In fact it would increase her suffering and frighten her so much."
3153,2020-04-13,Now our dementia unit is infested with covid and we had 3 deaths on that floor over the weekend alone. My heart hurts a lot
3154,2020-04-13,Everytime I see people disregard social distancing I want to place them in my shoes when I have to comfort my crying dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs patients who are without visitors and spend their lucid moments watching COVID updates thinking they‚Äôre going to die.
3155,2020-04-13,"Hey y'all, one of my very best friends in the world, Amy, is having a really rough time. Her 75 yr old mother just broke her pelvis and her dad cannot be left alone due to dementia. Today she is getting swabbed for COVID ffs. If you are the praying type please send her some"

3158,2020-04-13,A little bit of positivity. My husband out of hospital today after a nasty brush with covid 19. Still a way to go as dementia complicates things. But still good. So here‚Äôs some spring apple blossom. 
3159,2020-04-13,My mum died tonight. Not Covid. Dementia. It hurts so much :(
3160,2020-04-13,My Dad has severe vascular dementia- when he went into care home over two years ago we all agreed he was to get palliative care only - if he got Covid we would feel more reassured he spent his last days with those who now care for him than terrified in a hospital
3161,2020-04-13,Thinking of my brother in law's mother and step father today. Step father is 95 and in hospital with an infection (not Covid) but they don't think he'll come out and no one can visit him. His mother has (we think) got dementia and has carers. Horrible situation üòû

3165,2020-04-13,"My daughter works at a elderly hospital in the dementia ward and she had 5 deaths this week, none from covid, just you get a lot a lot deaths in old folks homes. Covid is not something they want on top of what they have to deal with on the daily."
3166,2020-04-13,"My mother-in-law died this week. Not of Covid. She was 103 and had dementia for some years. She used to tell me she wanted Amazing Grace at her funeral, which will will have to wait now. I always think of her when I hear it. üò¢"

3173,2020-04-12,"COVID-19 changes you. As a Boomer with my mother who has dementia, I wonder if I will now end up dying before she does. When the memory care facility locked down to all visitors, I had to face that I might not ever see her alive in person again. Grieving has come early."

3178,2020-04-12,"Just heard that my mum, who has dementia, has been admitted to hospital in the UK following a fall. She has an infection, probably not Covid. But 69 people have already died of it at that hospital! And my sister can‚Äôt be with her because of the risks! She must be so scared!"

3182,2020-04-12,Shout out to my fellow #Alzheimers and #dementia #caregivers out there during this covid quarantine. That which does not kill us makes us stronger and probably sleep deprived.
3183,2020-04-12,"So my dad died in the early hours of yesterday morning, not of Covid-19 but after a long brave battle with dementia. Too numb to say much more at the moment. This picture of him is from 2015. "
3184,2020-04-12,"I will tell you what I did, since my brother, who has dementia, is in one of only two state run veterans nursing facilities in my state, one of which basically hid numerous resident Covid deaths until a staff member basically became a whistleblower....."
3185,2020-04-12,Dont pretend like you really care. My elder residents with Dementia are declining so fast right now from isolation that it would tear apart the average person apart covid hasnt even touched my building but I expect to be burying my residents in the next weeks.
3186,2020-04-12,"One person doesnt mean an entire state needs to give up their rights, honestly Covid hasnt touched my retirement home but my folks with dementia are declining so fast in isolation its tearing me apart. I, and the high risk, as well as those living with the high risk should conti"

3189,2020-04-11,"Just finished a bag of Doritos,then suddenly noticed a couple lingering by my side - where I'd placed the bag.(As I gleefully reached for them,I realised they WERE the bag).I'm convinced Dementia is a prodrome of Covid - not a side effect of old age in the new age of Coronavirus"
3190,2020-04-11,"Further to my tweet about the Texas GOP doctor who is treating COVID patients with dementia w. Hydroxychoroquine w/out (in many cases) getting consent. Doing harm is the GOP brand these days, but really, it shouldn't be that hard to avoid comparisons with Mengele. "
3191,2020-04-11,"Oh Rosena, such sad news about your dad. My mum has dementia and each day she worries I have forgotten about her because I'm not visiting; and each day I have to remind her that I can't visit because of Covid-19 and I miss her terribly."
3192,2020-04-11,"my uncle is 90, he was in a dementia care home, fell and broke his hip, 12 hours in a hospital corridor, finally got seen to and was routinely checked for Covid 19, he tested positive."

3194,2020-04-11,My late mother was in seniors' homes the last couple of years of her life with dementia and the situation then was horrible and so sad before COVID-19. If one good thing comes out of this crisis it might be that a light has finally been shone on the problem and it might be fixed.
3195,2020-04-11,"A difficult day. My father, who has dementia, keeps begging me to visit. He lives on Vancouver Island, and all ferries are now designated essential travel only. Also, I'm high risk for COVID 19, and NONE of his ever-revolving nurses have been tested. Can't stop crying. üò¢"
3196,2020-04-11,"My Grandad passed away today. Although we don‚Äôt know if he had COVID yet, the nursing home was severely understaffed as nurses had to self isolate. Dementia residents then have to be locked in their rooms as they can‚Äôt be looked after. He died with no one there,Please stay home."
3197,2020-04-11,I want to go and give my mum a hug as she had to put her husband into a dementia home two weeks ago and is adjusting to the fact she can't go and see him and is now living alone. This Covid needs to do one and fast.
3198,2020-04-11,This is irresponsible; we should be scared by this physician‚Äôs actions. I supported a mom with dementia who was in a nursing home. I would have been livid to discover they administered drugs w/out my consent: via @nprnews: COVID-19 Patients Given Unproven Drug In Nursing Home
3199,2020-04-11,I don't think this is a result of the virus but of ICU Delirium. The article even states that pneumonia and stroke vistims suffer the same. My dad was in ventilator and in ICU for 14 days after a stroke. Had dementia after and died. No reason to cause more hysteria over Covid.
3200,2020-04-11,"My 85 year old stepmum Rosemary, who taught me what love was, died in a carehome this week. There won‚Äôt be a funeral. She had vascular dementia  and  COPD (my nurse cousin suspects Covid killed her) This piece is a tribute. #NotEvenAStatistic"
3201,2020-04-11,To me this virus ain't as bad as they say it is I don't know anybody two had this virus but my uncle died of dementia and they put him as done from covid-19 which is a lie so what is the real truth they're trying to scare us because the world is falling apart
3202,2020-04-11,"Just found out my friends #nana has died, not covid related, but she was in a nursing home as she had dementia, the home is isolating so no visits recently. üò• so terribly sad."
3203,2020-04-11,"Update...my mom's temp went up in consecutive readings to 101F, so she will be swabbed ASAP for COVID, staff will wear full PPE in her room, etc. Med dir on site said the PPE situation causes great concern for all folks w/dementia, they can't grasp the situation."
3204,2020-04-11,2/2 My mom's death certificate says cause of death was that her heart failed and under other conditions it mentions her malignant cancer. It doesn't mention dementia. If she had Covid would that change the other conditions? What would cert say was cause of death? I don't know.
3205,2020-04-11,Sorry to hear that. My mother is in a nursing home with some dementia. I am locked out because of COVID-19. She is 87 and I hope she makes it through until I can get back there.
3206,2020-04-10,Pray for my dad. He was taken to ER from nursing home. He has dementia and we can‚Äôt be with him. Let him not be afraid. Not COVID-19 related. May be stroke.
3207,2020-04-10,"Actually crying. Thank you. Today's been hard. On top of our financial stress bc of Covid-19, FB reminded me today's #SiblingsDay. Seeing past pics w/my brother broke me. He has severe dementia. Social distancing means I can't visit... and even if I could, he wouldn't know me. "
3208,2020-04-10,My Daddy is in a nursing home in FL with a COVID case. We are locked out too. We have to trust them. It's not easy to trust when they have made mistakes already. I hope you can talk to your mom by phone. Phone calls are saving me even though Daddy has dementia he still knows me.
3209,2020-04-10,"my bf, a nurse, was told by his manager that he was not allowed to wear a face shield or gown in the main hallways of the hospital because it‚Äôs against the joint commission standards? WTF? a COVID positive patient w/ dementia just kissed his face 3 times while he helped her."
3210,2020-04-10,Sorry to retweet my own tweet but we are asking care homes to perform the impossible. The reason people with dementia are in care homes is bcs it takes huge skill and team effort to care for them. It is a complex illness. To do this + nurse Covid patients + keep them separated..? 
3211,2020-04-10,My mum is in a care home locked Down a month today. There are no casualties with any Covid - 19. The staff are excellent and mum is safe. We speak on the phone or Zoom. It‚Äôs frustrating but at 84 years old with dementia understands and missing my visits of 5 x week. üåéüôè

3262,2020-04-09,Gosh this breaks my heart. It also highlights the lack of widespread education on dementia  and  alzheimer‚Äôs and seems to indicate a growing level of fear  and  panic from this pandemic within NYC. Continuing to pray for everyone affected by Covid  and  those helping around them.

4006,2020-09-02,I have family members who had strokes and vascular dementia and have suspected he may have same for years. But maybe the cerebral event and cognitive test was for being hit in the head by a can of soup.

4008,2020-09-01,I would rather a loved one have family with them & take a chance of getting Covid than have to be alone. This quarantine has been especially hard on the elderly with dementia. Better they should have constant contact with family before they forget them entirely. üò¢

4527,2020-05-30,"Good idea or bad idea? @Local12David spoke to one man who's concerned about his mother, who has dementia, staying in the same nursing home as COVID-positive patients: "
4528,2020-05-29,"The mother in law. Dementia, pneumonia, covid. Passed 2 covid tests in 2 weeks fails the 3rd one in hospital. So what killed her? Bearing in mind she has been ill for years"

4543,2020-04-30,"Surely care homes are journeying towards their own peak? With our own Covid positive dementia mother in care there is added complexity. The staff are absolutely fantastic, doing outstanding job but with staff numbers diminished. Where is the extra staff? Could NHS staff be used?"

4550,2020-04-21,A friend‚Äôs 91 yo mother with dementia passed away last week after complications from hip surgery after fallling. Cause of death...Covid. Docs are being incentivized to claim Covid as cause of death. What a hoax!
4551,2020-04-21,"Son in law's grandmother broke her hip, and also with early dementia. Goes into hospital, and gets put onto a ward with patients having tested positive for covid. Obviously going to contract it now. Labour run Welsh NHS. Thank God they're not the party in government."

4554,2020-04-13,I wish to visit as well but for different reasons. Mothers in Welshpool Hospital with dementia after a fall. Whilst she was in Shrewsbury hospital caught Covid-19 but only a mild dose so responded quickly to treatment. But fear she'll not remember me by time I see her next.
4555,2020-04-12,Do you think you're the only one with this problem? I had a 50 yr old cousin die from COVID and we can't even tell his mother because she's in a seniors home with dementia and we can't be with her. That's why I follow the rules. So others don't die.
4556,2020-04-11,"Day 28 of lockdown here in Spain. Extended until at least the 10th of May. Seriously over it now, as we have a very poorly 87 year old grandmother with dementia  and  zero mobility. No doctors will visit, can't take to the hospital or nursing home, due to #Covid_19 risks. üò¢"

4561,2020-04-03,70 yr old wife must care for 97 yr old mother w dementia in her own apartment cared for by home health aides not allowed to prep her medications.This was hard before #COVID. If the aide gets sick wife is required to cover. $4K hearing aid found in garbage. Mom probably lost it.
4562,2020-03-29,"See too many families, reporting grandmother had dementia was in hospice n blamed covid 19, others in hospice, blamed covid 19.. I dont listen to media. Not that covid doesn't exist, yes but not to what media frenzy..fake news"

4565,2020-03-27,Not just loved ones with covid-19 dying alone ... so are folks in retirements/nursing homes dying of anything. And a lot of those folks have some dementia which accentuates their touch with reality when close relatives are not near. 92 mother-in-law = case in point.
4566,2020-03-26,"Trying to explain to your grandmother, who has dementia, about COVID-19 and how she can‚Äôt leave her apartment til we don‚Äôt know when. I wouldn‚Äôt wish this upon anyone."

4584,2020-05-28,The unknown infection that PHE has identified in more care homes than Covid. They are mainly the very old  and  many are in late stage dementia so very vulnerable to infections. The data is available if you bother to look.
4585,2020-05-28,"They can't be bothered to differentiate between a death from gunshot, heart attack, stroke, cancer, car crash, dementia, Flu-like pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, and covid pneumonia...classifying them all as covid. But they found time to measure the ratio of their finger lengths."

4605,2020-08-19,"It would look like people having supports to remain in their homes. If that means 24 hour in-home care it can be done. We also have to build communities with dementia-friendly design. With over 80% of COVID deaths in Canada in LTCs, I feel we need to reimagine our care systems."

4610,2020-08-12,What‚Äôs even worse is the lack of effort to try and stop making it even worse. Get NHS back to work -not just for covid patients. Heard today from friend who‚Äôs mum has moderate to severe dementia. Took 3 months to get GP appointment. THREE MONTHS
4611,2020-08-12,"460 a day from heart disease.

4787,2020-06-23,I lost both Mum and Dad to dementia but there was always something there that was especially them. Mum died under Covid rules so i never got to see her.

4794,2020-06-09,"Great that figures are reducing! However I‚Äôm questioning the reporting. Dad-in-law went to hospital with covid, UTI, Parkinson‚Äôs, dementia, age 75. Drs advised palliative care - succumbed to covid. Died in palliative care home. No covid on med cert? Similar reports elsewhere."
4795,2020-06-09,"Thank you @JimWoodAD2  and  @Asm_Nazarian for their joint hearing on LTC communities.

4798,2020-06-02,Yesterday hearing mum shouting and getting stress cos dad had dementia and he think he going to as he retired but he had mind lose and don't what he saying/thinking/doing. And mum telling dad off. Can't stand living here sometimes  and  Covid-19 not helping.

4800,2020-05-29,Mum - who's been in hospital with covid and then In isolation in the care home - went upstair to see dad-with-dementia for the first time in eight weeks. She's the only person he still recognises and we were all afraid that he wouldn't any more. He recognised her! Xxx '

4802,2020-05-24,"I agree, I work in a funeral home and have seen first hand how some families have struggled with covid restrictions and having a Dad with dementia in lockdown is a nightmare but we have to deal with it. Apparently it's all about Brexit though ü§∑"
4803,2020-05-24,Grandad went into hospital last week for a emergency operation what he today recovered from only to be let home to me nan today who's got bad alzheimers and dementia without getting tested for covid surely they should of tested him after being in a high risk place for over a week
4804,2020-05-23,"M dad has dementia and lung cancer, he's been assessed in a covid free home, just got told that he needs to move to a permanent home, I start looking, told I had to hurry up and if I didn't he could and would be transferred to a place that is covid+. Please tell me ur thoughts"
4805,2020-05-20,"Looking at figures, it looks like it's not Gran who is most at risk. If Grandad lives long enough to go into Care he's the main target of Covid. Dementia and Alzheimer's are Grans worst enemies. Deaths in care homes up to May 1st."
4806,2020-05-18,"Sadly we lost Dad earlier this evening to COVID-19. This is how I want to remember him - lost in his thoughts about how to transform his sketches into 'great works of art'. Even in the early stages of dementia, he still sketched and painted. This was the last trip out he was 1/2 "
4807,2020-05-17,SPIRITUAL VS SCIENCE Dad passed due to extensive MI and aspiration pneumonia. Due to covid hospital lockdown unable to see him. was distraught as would be horrible to pass by yourself in isolation and being confused due to early dementia without loved one around...
4808,2020-05-15,"Thank you Darius‚Äôs Dad! The WH is turning into an insane asylum. Dr. Fauci should be leading the charge, not the Cluster B Personality Disorder with Stage 4/5 Dementia...clearly self medicating  and  is on the verge of a psychotic breakdown. 85,000 + dead Americans from Covid-19."
4809,2020-05-13,"Best photo ever. 61 wedding anniversary in a long term care home - after not seeing each other for weeks - their floors finally declared covid free. Mom - dementia - dad, Parkinson‚Äôs. Both 85. She recognized him - he said best day he‚Äôs ever had. #HappyAnniversary #COVID„Éº19"
4810,2020-05-09,"Update - Dad's test results from May 1 came back positive today. He remains on the COVID floor at Jackson Hospital. He is not on a vent - is stable, but very confused. He suffers from advanced dementia and broke his hip three weeks ago. Prayers."
4811,2020-05-07,"It‚Äôs truly sickening. Both grandparents tested positive. Grandad passed away in early April. Nan in restbite care, add dementia with Covid, she‚Äôs probably never going to be able to go back home again. Hope the Tory gutter press go bankrupt and we don‚Äôt see their poison again. "
4812,2020-05-07,Let me be clear. #COVID19 testing isn‚Äôt even close to readily available. Dad has been on a Covid hospital floor a week. Still no test results. He is 79. Dementia. Recovering broken hip. Kept sedated. Sucks.
4813,2020-05-05,"Grandad lived independently with Dementia for years, he would go into town daily,get his messages, pay his bills and visit his favourite cafes. Lockdown has rapidly deskilled him in so many ways. The hidden impacts of COVID are heartbreaking! We can‚Äôt be the only ones? @alzscot"
4814,2020-05-05,"Still no #COVID„Éº19 results for dad, age 79 with dementia. It has been six days since he has stood on his 2-week old hip. Can‚Äôt get rehab on Covid floor and he‚Äôll have to b tested again before allowed rehab. No rapid testing?!?!"
4815,2020-05-03,"...today not a good day for dad: agitated, restless, the covid lockdown  and  dementia = extra emotional stress for all, then there's the re-opening too soon? a: irrational, the calm before the biggest wave coming... ...spend extra time in His Word..."
4816,2020-05-03,"One hour after opening this we learn dad‚Äôs assisted living also is positive, he‚Äôs alone in the hospital with pneumonia and dementia. #COVID results not expected until next week. #alpolitics"
4817,2020-04-28,"It's getting a bit too close for comfort. Mum and Dad in a care home. Mum has a cough and has been tested for Covid 19. Mum and Dad share a room, so they are in isolation there together, til results come back. They both have dementia and don't really understand what's going on."
4818,2020-04-26,"You don't work then shop doesn't run as well mum doesn't work a home full of dementia patients goes without a nurse, dad doesn't work covid wards go without a porter to move things. It's a joke"
4819,2020-04-25,Just heard from K that her grandad on her Dad's side Edgar Washburn has passed - from dementia not covid. He had to go into a home as he showed serious signs - like being unable to find his car when he parked in town.
4820,2020-04-24,When the care home phones to say dad has had to go into hospital as he‚Äôs fallen & broken his wrist. Due to Covid I am not allowed to go to the hospital to see or be with him. #dementia #CoronavirusLockdown
4821,2020-04-23,They have also admitted they are recording some deaths as 'with Covid' even when they haven't actually done a test. Woman said the doctor said her 96 yo dad would be put down as with' even though he had been ill for months with heart disease and dementia and wasn't tested.
4822,2020-04-21,"The last few days have been really bad with dad's dementia. I think mom is finally getting what we have all been saying for a while now. Sadly though we may not be able to afford it, not to mention because of COVID-19 all those facilities are locked down."
4823,2020-04-16,"So sorry Hannah, both about the covid and the dementia - both terrible in their own way. I had no idea he was your grandad! What an amazing life and legacy xx"
4824,2020-04-09,"Terrible. Grandads own dementia home was locked down a few weeks ago. Worrying time for families, especially now with this news from London. Great sympathy with Hawthorn residents  and  families. Don't know the solution but hope we at least learn from COVID. "
4825,2020-04-09,"Phone call with Dad (a bit of dementia). ‚ÄòHow you going Dad, everything ok‚Äô ‚ÄòYes ok, I went to play golf yesterday and it was closed for a 19th Birthday Party, so I went to Weatherspoon‚Äôs and that was closed too, same party‚Äô ‚ÄòWas his name COVID by any chance‚Äô üôàüôàüôàüôàüôàüòÇüòÇ"

4827,2020-04-07,Dad has a fever. He has advanced dementia and in a long term care home. They are going to test him for COVID-19. Let's hope it's something else. So frustrating I can't see him and he doesn't understand why.
4828,2020-04-06,Confirmed today that dad‚Äôs cause of death was Covid-19 Pneumonia and end stage dementia. Due to the practicalities of a 5hr drive to North Wales and then straight back afterwards we‚Äôve had to take the gut wrenching decision not to attend the funeral service. üò¢
4829,2020-04-03,Life update: dads still in coma! No sign of waking up anytime soon Grandpa has covid too! They won‚Äôt hospitalize him because he has dementia

4831,2020-04-02,Looking for suggestions on caring for parents during #coronavirus. Dad insists on watching news but has dementia and it is not a good combination. Mom definitely needs a project to help with anxiety. Thought‚Äôs?? #dementiaduringcoronavirus #COVID19 #COVID

4846,2020-09-03,"Exactly. Death certificates can list multiple causes. The ""underlying cause"" is what causes someone to die at that moment but the ""real"" cause could be dementia or cancer or heart disease, i.e. Covid or flu could only kill them because they had something else. Its complicated."
4847,2020-09-02,Sorry about your mom. This is a perfect example of the problem of death certificates outlined above. Dementia is an underlying condition (aka a co-morbidity). It was the viral infection called COVID that was the primary cause of death.

4861,2020-08-01,It's common now to hear covid being called a cruel disease. Compared to dementia it's a blessed relief. No one can understand the years of dread  and  moments of horror those who care live through until you have to do it. And it doesn't end with the move to a care home. Poor couple

4985,2020-06-04,Lewis thank you for continuing to raise this issue. Mum died who had dementia a few years ago and there would have been no hope of her isolating when she was mobile. This is why it was so important we keep covid out of homes.
4986,2020-06-02,Our thoughts are with Sharon Chalk today. A daughter we supported when she lost her lovely mum to Covid 19. She sent us this photo attending her mums funeral and wearing a purple ribbon in honour of those living with dementia who sadly lost their lives during this pandemic

4989,2020-05-29,"It matters who runs the country. We haven't seen our mum for months, she's in the latter stages of progressive dementia. Two out of three UK care homes have been spared a covid outbreak so far, but the government should have acted earlier and listened to health officials. "
4990,2020-05-28,"Mum works in a care home. One resident was taken to hospital, tested +ve & returned to the care home to isolate. Do you understand how hard it is to help a resident w dementia isolate in a care home w other elderly/ill ppl  and  no structure for covid in place? The resident died. "
4991,2020-05-26,SIL was allowed to go see 97 year old mum today in LTC...only because she is now designated Palliative...has dementia and has been steadily declining since lockdown. She's declining food  and  not speaking. She tested + for Covid 3wk ago but it's not the virus that's killing her.

4996,2020-05-23,"People think I‚Äôm being overly cautious shielding her because dementia doesn‚Äôt put you in the COVID high risk category, but they don‚Äôt have a clue - it‚Äôs horrendous dealing with illness on top of the normal stresses of the condition. Your mum is an absolute champ üíö"

4999,2020-05-14,Had a call today. The #Covid virus has entered mum's wing. There are 2 cases that are being quarantined. They rang for permission to test mum ad they want to test all. This is a dementia only wing. Imagine keeping the 'wanderers' isolated!
5000,2020-05-10,"News isn't good at all. They feel Mum had early stages of dementia and once she fell, it got out of control. Add covid-19 to that and now she's on end of life treatment. She's comfortable, sleeping and out of pain. I can see her again today"
5001,2020-05-09,"Well, no! Her daughter said her 92-year-old mum recovered from COVID-19. Her death was due to dementia. Let's not create fear where none is warranted. There's enough fear already for everyone to deal with."

Dementia mum melting down mentally. Asked said NHS instructs  and  not fair if I do
5003,2020-05-07,"I can relate with that! Not being a mum, but being the sole caregiver of a person with dementia. At times, I'm still awake at 4 a.m. You so want time to yourself, but you can't permit someone to come into the house for fear COVID-19 will follow. So we'll continue to be consumed."
5004,2020-05-05,"Having had a Covid test on Saturday and having to do the test on Mum, please don't underestimate what needs to be done. Doing a throat swab especially on someone with dementia is not easy. We had to go to a Military pop up site and they are not allowed to help you. "

5007,2020-04-29,Mum in home with dementia  and  very frail. Not sure she knows who I am sadly won't realise I can't visit as doesn't remember or process info. She is well cared for and home has full PPE and no covid. A quadrangle with lawn and benches for sitting out. Safer if I don't visit as work
5008,2020-04-27,On mums certificate it‚Äôs says Covid-19 with Dementia as underlying cause. So is this marked twice or do they only see the first words.
5009,2020-04-23,Some good news that people with dementia  and  carers on @SimonHarrisTD radar. As Senator I fought hard with @MaryButlerTD and others for a nationwide network of Dementia Advisers as minimum. Home care urgently needed too as Covid 19 deaths in nursing homes shows @alzheimersocirl
5010,2020-04-22,In Stepney.. Frail mainly older people many of whom probably have dementia so it is incredibly difficult to enable social distancing for residents or the staff paid around the minimum wage... These people are far more likely to be impacted by COVID-19.. We are not all in it
5011,2020-04-22,They are usually holders of human rights visas or parent of a British child visas. I have several clients on such visas who struggle to get by and are working in care homes with dementia patients during COVID for little more than minimum wage. They deserve an extension too.
5012,2020-04-20,"Hi Roberta quite stressed, but ok. Mum has advanced dementia but became unwell last Thursday- maybe Covid, maybe something else we don‚Äôt know. So I‚Äôm here trying to nurse her at home because we don‚Äôt want her to go into hospital and be on her own unless it‚Äôs unavoidable."

5014,2020-04-17,"Hi Twitter gang, I know I'll not be missed much. But just to say will not be around for a few days as mum passed away a couple of hours ago. She beat Covid-19, but not the dementia. Stay safe and have a great weekend."
5015,2020-04-14,"Mum had dementia for nine long years, the first seven of which she lived with us. When we no longer could provide the safety she needed, she went into an MHA home - one which now has COVID-19 cases. Their care was faultless but I too will never forget how full of despair I was.üíî"
5016,2020-04-10,"Me mums worked in the covid ward for a week now an the stories are heartbreaking so emotional üòî these patients so sick an so scared, some even really old an with dementia, an there families can‚Äôt even go to see them to make them feel betterü•∫ I wish I could even go an see themüíî"
5017,2020-04-05,"Perfect hymn. Religion is clearly not important here. Fact is a young mum died - shouldn‚Äôt matter how or why. Her nursing work was important pre and during Covid-19. I just had to call it out. May God safeguard all frontline workers of faith or no faith, NHS or outside NHS"
5018,2020-04-05,"Mum was in care with dementia and they wanted us to sign a DNAR, long before the covid virus. I think it's practice in this Country. They continued to push for it until she became frail and we signed because the procedure would not have benefitted her in any way. üòî"
5019,2020-04-03,Really????? Mum was admitted to a care home in 2016 work dementia at 80 yrs old. We were called in  and  advised to put a DNAR in place the first week! We were shocked. No covid 19 then. Just policy. She was still able to walk talk and run at the time. As she showed themüòä
5020,2020-04-01,"Mum is finding COVID-19 really hard as she has dementia  and  can't understand why she can't go out. I have to remind her several times a day as she forgets  and  then gets upset. Every day is like groundhog day, she can't understand why no-one is allowed to visit her. Be safe everyone"
5021,2020-03-28,"I'm stunned that dementia sufferers are not on the @GOVUK 'vulnerable people list'. I have an 86 yo Mum with dementia, recently left respite care after hospitalisation. Not on the list. @MattHancock @NHS @ocado @sainsburys #vulnerable #COVID19 #Covid_19"
5022,2020-03-22,"It was 12¬¢ to buy a 'No' a few weeks ago ... 84ish for a 'Yes' - 3-4¬¢ spread is typical. The maximum upside is @$1 with a 2.5% withdrawal free, but it's better return than I can get on crypto right now. CoVID-19, indictment, Hillary, dementia - I like the odds."
5023,2020-03-22,I am taking food to supposed self-isolating mum today and shall talk across the drive. Also food drop to grandma. Her dementia means she doesn't understand Covid. She lives home alone so will be a tricky few months. Been up since 4am worrying.
5024,2020-03-13,"Visit to mum next week called off because I still have some sort of chest infection. Mum has severe dementia, is in a care home and I am hoping she makes it to 80 in May. Of course she is just a statistic to Boris and his cronies. Feeling a bit glum. #COVID_19uk #selfisolating"

5035,2020-07-27,"That is so true! During a time when I was taking care of two parents with dementia, it was the simple random kindness of strangers that would get me through another intolerable-feeling day. Learned a lot from that. Just eye contact and a smile. Harder in COVID times."
